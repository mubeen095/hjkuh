<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Experience: Your experience plays a significant role in determining your software engineer&#8217;s salary. Employers highly value engineers with more experience, who are skilled in specific programming languages or technologies. On average, a software engineer with 4 to 9 years of experience can expect to earn around INR 8.8 LPA (Lakhs Per Annum). Those with 10 to 20 years of experience may earn around INR 20.1 LPA.</li>



<li>Location: Salaries in India, like in many other countries, vary based on location. Generally, urban areas offer higher salaries compared to smaller towns or rural places where job opportunities are fewer. For example, Bangalore provides the highest average salary with a CTC (Cost to Company) of INR 9 LPA.</li>



<li>Company Size: Big companies pay more than smaller ones because they have more money. They can afford to give their employees higher salaries. For example, Google, a global brand, pays an average salary of INR 40 LPA, which is much higher than what a local private company can pay.</li>



<li>Industry: Your computer engineer salary in India can also be influenced by the industry you work in. For example, software development and design roles generally pay more compared to jobs in accounting or marketing within the same company. Full stack web developers are highly sought after, with an average salary ranging from INR 2.4 LPA to INR 20 LPA. This field is expected to grow by 27% until 2024.</li>



<li>Education Level: Your education level also plays a role in determining your starting salary as a software engineer in India. Those with a bachelor&#8217;s degree can expect around INR 3.45 LPA, while engineers with a master&#8217;s degree can earn about INR 8.63 LPA per annum.</li>
