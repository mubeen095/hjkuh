</ul>



<p>11.<strong>Handling schema changes:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Migrate data:</strong> Update existing documents to the new schema using scripts or migration tools.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain backward compatibility:</strong> Support both old and new versions of the schema to avoid breaking existing applications.</li>
</ul>



<p>12.<strong>Geospatial data in MongoDB:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
