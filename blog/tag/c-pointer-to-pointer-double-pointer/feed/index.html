<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="c-pointer-to-pointer-double-pointer">C – Pointer To Pointer (Double Pointer)</h2>



<p>A pointer-to-pointer (double pointer) is used to store the address of another pointer. The first pointer stores the address of a variable, and the second pointer stores the address of the first pointer. This makes them useful for changing the values of normal pointers or creating variable-sized 2-D arrays. Importantly, a double pointer occupies the same amount of memory as a regular pointer on the stack.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="declaration-of-pointer-to-a-pointer-in-c">Declaration of Pointer to a Pointer in C</h2>



<p>We know that declaring a pointer will be similar to declaring a double pointer in C. The only difference, we can notice is the adding of * just before the pointer name.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>data_type_of_pointer **name_of_variable = &amp; normal_pointer_variable;
int val = 5;
int *ptr = &amp;val;    // storing address of val to pointer ptr.
int **d_ptr = &amp;ptr; // pointer to a pointer declared
                    // which is pointing to an integer. </code></pre>



<p>Therefore, this diagram illustrates the first pointer ptr 1 will store the address of the variable and the second pointer ptr 2 can store the address of the first pointer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-of-double-pointer-in-c">Example of Double Pointer in C</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to demonstrate pointer to pointer
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main()
{
    int var = 789;
 
    // pointer for var
    int* ptr2;
 
    // double pointer for ptr2
    int** ptr1;
 
    // storing address of var in ptr2
    ptr2 = &amp;var;
 
    // Storing address of ptr2 in ptr1
    ptr1 = &amp;ptr2;
 
    // Displaying value of var using
    // both single and double pointers
    printf("Value of var = %d\n", var);
    printf("Value of var using single pointer = %d\n", *ptr2);
    printf("Value of var using double pointer = %d\n", **ptr1);
 
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Value of var = 789
Value of var using single pointer = 789
Value of var using double pointer = 789</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-double-pointer-works">How Double Pointer Works?</h2>



<p>Int var =10;</p>



<p>int*ptr =&amp;var;</p>



<p>*ptr=20;</p>



<p>Int**ptr=&amp;ptr;</p>



<p>**ptr=30;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Declare a double-pointer with the appropriate syntax.</li>



<li>Store the address of another pointer as the value of the double-pointer.</li>



<li>To manipulate or dereference to any of its levels, use the asterisk (<code>*</code>) operator the number of times needed to reach the desired level.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="size-of-pointer-to-pointer-in-c">Size of Pointer to Pointer in C</h2>



<p>A double-pointer acts similarly to a normal pointer in C. Also, the size of the pointer is equal to a double pointer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example 1: C Program to find the size of a pointer to a pointer</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
// C program to find the size of pointer to pointer
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main()
{
    // defining single and double pointers
    int a = 5;
    int* ptr = &amp;a;
    int** d_ptr = &amp;ptr;
 
    // size of single pointer
    printf(" Size of normal Pointer: %d \n", sizeof(ptr));
 
    // size of double pointer
    printf(" Size of Double Pointer: %d \n", sizeof(d_ptr));
 
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code> Size of normal Pointer: 8 
 Size of Double Pointer: 8 </code></pre>



<p>The size of a pointer in C is not fixed and can vary based on factors like CPU architecture and the operating system. Typically, for a 64-bit operating system, pointer sizes are 8 bytes, while for a 32-bit operating system, they are 4 bytes. This size variation is important to consider when working with pointers, especially when dealing with memory allocation and ensuring your code is compatible across different platforms and systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="application-of-double-pointers-in-c">Application of Double Pointers in C</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dynamic Memory Allocation: Double-pointers are used to allocate and manage memory for multidimensional arrays, enabling flexible data structures.</li>



<li>Multilevel Data: They are used to store and manage complex hierarchical data structures, like text documents with paragraphs, sentences, and words.</li>



<li>Data Structures: In data structures, double-pointers allow direct manipulation of node addresses without copying data, improving efficiency.</li>



<li>Function Arguments: Double-pointers can be used as function arguments to modify the addresses stored in local pointers, facilitating efficient data manipulation.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="multilevel-pointers-in-c">Multilevel Pointers in C</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In C, we have multilevel pointers beyond double pointers.</li>



<li>For changing the value of a double pointer, we can use a triple pointer, such as <code>int ***t_ptr</code>.</li>



<li>Syntax: <code>pointer_type ***pointer_name;</code></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="syntax-of-triple-pointer">Syntax of Triple Pointer</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pointer_type *** pointer_name;  
</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This concept extends further, allowing us to use &#8220;level &#8211; x + 1&#8221; pointers to change the value of a &#8220;level &#8211; x&#8221; variable, and this can be carried to higher levels as needed.</li>
</ul>

<div id="faq-question-1697451639177" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. How to return a double pointer array in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Declaring a 2D array like <code>int input[][c_in]</code> doesn&#8217;t make the computer interpret these as pointers. <code>input[x][y]</code> represents integers directly, not memory addresses. If you&#8217;re getting addresses when printing, check your code for any issues. Use <code>printf("%d", input[x][y]);</code> to print integer values.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1697451674862" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. What is the advantage of a double-pointer?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Double pointers in C are powerful tools for efficiently managing data in memory. They allow you to access and manipulate memory addresses, making them versatile for tasks like data reorganization. A pointer, as the name suggests, points to a specific location in memory, enabling you to work with data effectively.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What are the two types of pointers in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Those are four types of pointers. Those are :<br />Null Pointer.<br />Void Pointer.<br />Wild Pointer.<br />Dangling Pointer.</p>
