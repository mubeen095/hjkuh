<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-html">What is HTML?</h2>



<p><strong>What is HTML: </strong>HTML is a Hyper Text Markup Language that functions to create web pages and web applications. In this article, you will get to know more about what is HTML.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyper-text">Hyper Text </h2>



<p>Hypertext is a way of showing information on the internet. It uses hyperlinks to connect different web pages or parts of the same page. When you click on these hyperlinks, you can quickly jump to related content or completely different web pages. It makes exploring the digital world super easy and interconnected!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="markup-language">Markup Language </h2>



<p>A markup language is a computer language required to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language will make the text more interactive and dynamic. Additionally, it can turn text into images, tables, links, etc. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="web-page">Web Page </h2>



<p>A web page is like a document made using a special language called HTML. When you type a web address (URL) in your browser, it brings the web page and shows it to you. </p>



<p>There are two main types of web pages: static and dynamic. Static web pages are simple and made only with HTML. They stay the same for everyone and are used for basic information that doesn&#8217;t change much. Dynamic web pages are more advanced. They use HTML along with other languages like JavaScript or PHP. These pages can change and show different things based on what you do. They are used for interactive websites and applications. You can also refer to What is HTML to get more details about HTML. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="description-of-html">Description of HTML </h2>



<p><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</strong></p>



<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is placed at the very beginning of the HTML document, before the &lt;html&gt; tag. </p>



<p><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong></p>



<p>In HTML, the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration serves the purpose of notifying the browser that it is an HTML document. However, the actual content of the web page is enclosed within the &lt;html&gt; tag. This&lt;html&gt; tag marks the beginning of the web document. </p>



<p>&lt;<strong>head</strong>&gt;</p>



<p>The &lt;head&gt; element is like the brain of a web page. It comes at the beginning and holds important information about the page. This includes the title, links to other things the page needs, and details about special characters. It&#8217;s essential to close the &lt;head&gt; before starting the main content of the page in the &lt;body&gt; element.</p>



<p><strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong></p>



<p>The &lt;title&gt; tag is like the name of a web page. It appears at the top of the browser window or tab when you open a webpage. It tells you what the page is about, like a little sneak peek into its content. For example, if the title is &#8220;What is HTML,&#8221; it means the page will teach you about HTML. So, it&#8217;s essential to choose a good title for your web page!</p>



<p><strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong></p>



<p>When someone visits your website, their browser looks at what&#8217;s inside the &lt;body&gt; tag and shows it to them on the screen. So, whatever you put inside the &lt;body&gt; tag is what your visitors will see and experience on your website. </p>



<p><strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong></p>



<p>We can make different sizes of headings using special tags like &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;. The &lt;h1&gt; tag makes the biggest heading, while &lt;h6&gt; makes the smallest.  The &lt;h1&gt; heading is like the main title that tells everyone what the adventure is about. It&#8217;s the most important heading on the page. Then we have the &lt;h2&gt; heading, which is like a subtitle, supporting the main title. It gives more details about the content. </p>



<p><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></p>



<p>In the world of HTML, the &lt;p&gt; tag is like a special tool that helps us create paragraphs on a webpage. It&#8217;s as simple as putting your text between the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags. </p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="history-of-html">History Of  HTML</h2>



<p>In the late 1980s, a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee was working as a contractor at CERN when he had a brilliant idea. He proposed a system that would help researchers at CERN by using hypertext on the internet. In 1989, he shared his concept in a memo outlining how this internet-based hypertext system could work.</p>



<p>As time went on, Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s idea evolved, and he became known as the &#8220;father of HTML.&#8221; He provided a definition for &#8216;What is HTML&#8217; and played a significant role in shaping the early version of HTML and documented it in a document called &#8220;HTML tags.&#8221; </p>



<p>As the internet continued to develop, so did HTML. The latest and most advanced version is known as HTML5. It comes with exciting new features and improvements that make it easier for web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="different-versions-of-html">Different Versions of HTML </h3>



<p><strong>HTML 1.0</strong></p>



<p>At that time, HTML 1.0 was quite simple and had limited features compared to what we have now with HTML5. It offered the essential elements needed to build a webpage, but it lacked many of the advanced functionalities we use today.</p>



<p><strong>HTML 2.0</strong> </p>



<p>Back in 1995, a significant version of HTML called HTML 2.0 was introduced. This became the standard language for designing websites during that time. The exciting part was that HTML 2.0 brought in some great improvements, making websites more functional and interactive.</p>



<p>In addition, HTML 2.0 introduced different form elements like text boxes and option buttons. These elements made it easier for web developers to create user-friendly forms on web pages, allowing visitors to interact with websites more comfortably. </p>



<p><strong>HTML 3.2</strong></p>



<p>HTML 3.2 allowed web developers to create tables, making it easier to organize and present data on web pages. It also provided additional options for form elements, enhancing user interactions with forms. Moreover, HTML 3.2 included support for displaying complex mathematical equations, catering to websites with scientific or mathematical content. </p>



<p><strong>HTML 4.01</strong> </p>



<p>HTML 4.01 was a cool version that added scripts for multimedia elements. This made web pages more interactive and fun for users. Even with newer versions like HTML5, HTML 4.01 stayed popular. It worked well with different web browsers, making it a valuable tool for web development.</p>



<p><strong>HTML5 </strong></p>



<p>HTML5 is known for its ability to create more dynamic and interactive web experiences. It supports multimedia elements, making it easier to integrate videos, audio, and animations into web pages. HTML5 is widely supported by various browsers and devices, making it the preferred choice for modern web development. </p>
