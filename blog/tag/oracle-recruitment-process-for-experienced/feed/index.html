It begins with an online application, followed by initial screenings and phone interviews to shortlist suitable candidates.

This thorough approach ensures that Oracle recruits well-suited individuals to contribute effectively. This blog mostly focuses on the Oracle Recruitment Process 2024- a step-by-step process.</p>



<p>Oracle is a multinational computer technology company that mainly develops and markets database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems.

Oracle forms employment decisions based on merit, experience, and potential without considering race, color, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age religion, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic, that is restricted by federal, state, or local law.</p>



<p> Oracle will allow you to learn from online learning such as LinkedIn Learning, O&#8217;Reilly Book Online, Harvard MangeMentor, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. They will support your new career and achieve your career goals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oracle-recruitment-process-for-freshers-2024">Oracle Recruitment Process For Freshers 2024</h2>



<p>Oracle Recruitment Process has 3-4 rounds to recruit freshers in the role of Software Engineers. This involves an online Test, Technical Interview Round 1, Technical Interview Round 2, and HR Round.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-online-test"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Online test</strong></h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-technical-interview"><strong>2. Technical Interview</strong> </h3>



<p> In technical Interviews, candidates face interviews with experienced software professionals from Oracle. During this round, their technical expertise, coding skills, and understanding of programming concepts are thoroughly evaluated.</p>



<p>If successful in the previous round, candidates move on to the Technical Interview Round 2, which often involves more in-depth technical questions, coding challenges, and discussions about their approach to problem-solving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-hr-round"><strong>3. HR Round </strong></h3>



<p>In the HR Round, candidates will interact with human resources professionals from Oracle. This round focuses on assessing the candidate&#8217;s soft skills, communication abilities, cultural fit, and overall suitability for the company&#8217;s work environment.</p>



<p>Throughout this multi-round process, Oracle aims to identify the best talents who possess the necessary technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and personal attributes to excel as Software Engineers within the company.</p>
