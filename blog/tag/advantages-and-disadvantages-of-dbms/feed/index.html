<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-dbms">Advantages and Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>



<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is like a special computer program that helps us organize and keep track of information. It&#8217;s like a virtual filing cabinet where we can create, store, and manage data.</p>



<p>With a DBMS, we can do many things. For example, we can create our custom categories for different types of information, like names, ages, and grades. We can also add, change, or delete information whenever we need to.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just about keeping the information safe; it also helps us find what we need quickly. For example, if we want to know the names of students who got A grades, the DBMS can find that information for us.</p>



<p>DBMS also takes care of making sure that only authorized people can access certain information. This helps keep data secure and ensures that only the right people can see sensitive things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-dbms">Advantages of DBMS </h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-redundancy-problem-can-be-solved">Redundancy Problem Can Be Solved</h3>



<p>DBMS prevents duplicate data by keeping everything in one place. No wastage or confusion. Simple and organized.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="has-a-very-high-security-level">Has a Very High-Security Level</h3>



<p>It protects your important data from unauthorized access. Additionally, authorized users can access the database with the help of credentials.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="presence-of-data-integrity">Presence of Data Integrity</h3>



<p>Data integrity will unite many files  into a single file. DDMS   offers data integrity and further, this can reduce data duplicity, Data integration, reduce redundancy as well as data inconsistency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="support-multiple-users">Support Multiple Users </h3>



<p>DDMS has a special feature that is, it will enable multiple users to access same database without any interpretation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="avoidance-of-inconsistency">Avoidance of inconsistency</h3>



<p>DBMS controls redundancy and ensures data consistency. Data is stored in a single database, easy updates, and no need to update all files. More consistent than file systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="shared-data">Shared Data</h3>



<p>In DBMS, authorized users can share data. Each user has specific access rights. The Admin has full control and can assign user permissions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="following-rules-and-guidelines">Following Rules and Guidelines </h3>



<p>DBMS central control allows the DBA to enforce data standards, formats, and security. This ensures consistency and simplifies data migrations and interchanges</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="any-unauthorized-access-is-restricted">Any Unauthorized Access is Restricted </h3>



<p>Unauthorized users are restricted to access the database due to the security credentials.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ensure-backup-of-data">Ensure Backup of Data </h3>



<p>DBMS automatically backs up data and ensures easy recovery, solving the problem of data loss without wasting time and resources.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tunability">Tunability</h3>



<p>DBMS tuning means making adjustments for better performance. The DBA optimizes the database settings to achieve effective results.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="disadvantages-of-dbms">Disadvantages of DBMS </h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="complexity">Complexity</h2>



<p>A good DBMS has complex functionality, requiring understanding from designers, developers, administrators, and end-users. Lack of understanding can result in bad design decisions with serious consequences for an organization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="size">Size </h3>



<p>The extensive functionality of the DBMS demands a significant amount of disk space, occupying megabytes of storage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="performance">Performance </h3>



<p>It won&#8217;t run as fast as desired.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="higher-impact-of-failure">Higher Impact of Failure </h3>



<p>Centralizing resources in a DBMS makes the system more vulnerable. All users and applications depend on its availability, and any failure can bring operations to a halt.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cost-of-ddms">Cost of DDMS </h3>



<p><br>The pricing of a DBMS can differ significantly, depending on factors like the environment and the range of functionalities it provides. Moreover, there is an annual maintenance cost that needs to be considered.</p>
