<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Of The Following Types Of Virtualization Is Also Characteristic Of Cloud Computing?</h2>



<p>Answer. Option D) All of the mentioned is the Correct Option.</p>



<p>Cloud computing typically involves various forms of virtualization, including:</p>



<p>a. <strong>Storage Virtualization</strong>: This allows for the abstraction of physical storage resources, making them accessible and manageable as virtual storage. In cloud computing, various storage services and options are available, often abstracting underlying physical storage infrastructure.</p>



<p>b. <strong>Application Virtualization</strong>: This refers to techniques that separate software applications from the underlying hardware and operating systems, allowing them to run independently and in isolated environments. Cloud platforms often provide the means to deploy and manage applications in a virtualized manner, such as through containerization and serverless computing.</p>



<p>c. <strong>CPU Virtualization (Server Virtualization)</strong>: This involves the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that run on physical servers, allowing multiple VMs to share the same physical hardware while remaining isolated from each other. Cloud providers use CPU virtualization extensively to offer scalable and flexible computing resources to users.</p>



<p>So, all of these types of virtualization (storage, application, and CPU) are characteristic of cloud computing environments.</p>
