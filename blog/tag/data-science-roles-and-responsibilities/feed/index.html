<p></p>



<p><strong>a. Collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/which-of-the-following-is-performed-by-data-scientist/" data-type="post" data-id="2839">Data scientists</a> will collect, clean, and&nbsp;analyze&nbsp;large amounts of data&nbsp;from various sources. They will investigate patterns and relationships between variables to identify trends or correlations. The tasks they have to undertake are :</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cleaning data on a spreadsheet</li>



<li>Organizing data into data frames in <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/mern-stack-vs-python-full-stack/" data-type="post" data-id="4241">Python</a></li>



<li>Applying statistical packages in R to analyze data</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>b.  Developing predictive models</strong></p>



<p>We know that after the data is collected and organized, the data scientist will create predictive models and is used to forecast trends or results. These models show machine learning algorithms to find deeper insights into datasets.</p>



<p>Several models are improved and updated to remain valuable. Some examples are :</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Building a simple clustering model on<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/tableau-interview-questions-and-answer/" data-type="post" data-id="3992"> Tableau</a></li>



<li>Running <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions-and-answers/" data-type="post" data-id="3717">machine learning algorithms</a> on Apache Spark</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>c. Enhancing existing analytics platforms</strong></p>



<p>Data scientists will improve  existing analytics platforms by adding new features and capabilities such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Plotting quick and simple graphs on&nbsp;Jupyter Notebooks&nbsp;to share among the data team.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>e. Developing algorithms</strong></p>



<p>Data scientists use programming languages like <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/mern-stack-vs-python-full-stack/" data-type="post" data-id="4241">Python </a>or R to create algorithms, automating tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, or model selection. This automation minimizes manual work, making processes more efficient for organizations.</p>



<p><strong>f.Translating technical concepts into non-technical language</strong></p>



<p>The data scientist plays a crucial role in making technical concepts clear to non-technical users. They need to explain complex analysis results in a way that everyone can easily understand. This skill ensures effective communication between technical and non-technical teams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-data-scientist-tools">What are the Data Scientist tools?</h2>
