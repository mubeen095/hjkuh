<p>Ans. Option 3 ) Round robin is the Correct Answer.</p>



<p>The CPU scheduling algorithm called &#8220;Round Robin&#8221; is used in operating systems to give each task a turn to use the CPU for a fixed amount of time. It&#8217;s like a circular rotation, making sure each task gets an equal share of CPU time. However, this is different from how Azure Traffic Manager routes network traffic to endpoints, which has its own methods and doesn&#8217;t involve CPU scheduling.</p>
