<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="c-functions">C Functions</h2>



<p>C functions, often referred to simply as &#8220;functions,&#8221; are fundamental building blocks in the world of programming. They play a pivotal role in making code modular, organized, and efficient. Functions allow programmers to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces of code, making it easier to design, debug, and maintain software. Whether you&#8217;re a novice programmer or an experienced developer, understanding how C functions work and how to harness their power is essential for writing clean, structured, and functional programs. In this exploration of C functions, we will delve into their syntax, usage, and the many advantages they bring to the realm of programming.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-function-of-c">What is the Function Of C</h2>



<p>In the C programming language, a function is a collection of statements that, when invoked, carry out a particular task. These functions serve as the fundamental units of a C program, promoting modularity and enabling the reuse of code segments. The statements within a function are enclosed within curly braces {}, each with its own unique purpose and operation. In some other programming languages, functions are also referred to as subroutines or procedures. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="syntax-of-functions-in-c">Syntax of Functions in C</h2>



<p>The syntax of function can be divided into 3 aspects:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Function Declaration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Function Definition</strong></li>



<li><strong>Function Calls</strong></li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-function-declarations">1. Function Declarations</h2>



<p>When declaring a function in C, it&#8217;s crucial to provide three key pieces of information: the function name, its return type, and details about its parameters, including their number and data types. Essentially, a function declaration informs the compiler that a function with the specified name exists elsewhere in the program, and it outlines how the function should be used. This declaration serves as a blueprint for the compiler, allowing it to check for correctness and compatibility when the function is called in the code.</p>



<p><strong>Syntax </strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>return_type name_of_the_function (parameter_1, parameter_2);
</code></pre>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>int sum(int a, int b);
int sum(int , int);</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-function-definition">2. Function Definition</h2>



<p>In C programming, a function definition includes the actual statements that are executed when the function is called, which happens when the program&#8217;s control reaches that specific function.</p>



<p>Typically, a C function is both defined and declared in a single step. This is because the function definition always starts with the function declaration, so there&#8217;s no need to explicitly declare it separately. In this way, the function can be both defined (with its code) and declared (with its name, return type, and parameter information) together.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>return_type function_name (para1_type para1_name, para2_type para2_name)
{
    // body of the function
}</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-function-call">3. Function Call</h2>



<p>A function call is a statement that tells the compiler to execute a specific function. To make a function call, you use the function&#8217;s name and provide any required parameters as arguments. The function then executes the code within its body, using the provided arguments as input to perform its task</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to show function
// call and definition
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
// Function that takes two parameters
// a and b as inputs and returns
// their sum
int sum(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
  // Calling sum function and
  // storing its value in add variable
  int add = sum(10, 30);
   
  printf("Sum is: %d", add);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Sum is: 40
</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="function-return-type">Function Return Type</h4>



<p>In C and many other programming languages, the return type of a function specifies the type of value that the function will return after its execution. For functions that do not need to return a value, the <code>void</code> data type is used as the return type. This signifies that the function doesn&#8217;t produce any result that needs to be captured or used by the caller.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>int func(parameter_1,parameter_2);
</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="function-arguments">Function Arguments </h4>



<p>Function arguments, also known as function parameters, are the pieces of data that are passed into a function when it is called. These arguments serve as inputs to the function, allowing it to perform its task with specific values or data provided by the caller.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>int function_name(int var1, int var2);
</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conditions-of-return-types-and-arguments">Conditions of Return Types and Arguments</h2>



<p>In C programming, functions can be grouped into four types:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>No arguments, no return value.</li>



<li>No arguments, with a return value.</li>



<li>With arguments, no return value.</li>



<li>With arguments, with a return value.</li>
</ol>



<p>These categories cover the various ways functions can be used based on their input and output requirements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-c-function-work">How Does C Function Work?</h2>



<p>In programming, there are several key steps involved in working with functions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Declaring a function:</strong> This step involves declaring a function by specifying its return type and parameters. It tells the compiler what the function looks like and how it should be used.</li>



<li><strong>Defining a function:</strong> Defining a function is where you actually provide the implementation or code for the function. It&#8217;s where you write the statements that the function will execute when called.</li>



<li><strong>Calling the function:</strong> Calling a function means using it in your code. You pass the necessary arguments to the function when you call it, and it executes its code with those values.</li>



<li><strong>Executing the function:</strong> This step is where the function&#8217;s code is run, and it performs the tasks or calculations it was designed for. It processes the input data and produces the desired result.</li>



<li><strong>Returning a value:</strong> Some functions return a value after execution, which is often used in the calling code. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in other parts of the program.</li>



<li><strong>Exiting the function:</strong> After the function has completed its tasks and, if applicable, returned a value, it exits. This step involves cleaning up any resources used by the function, such as memory allocation, before control returns to the main part of the program.</li>
</ol>



<p>These steps collectively define how functions work in programming, allowing for modular and reusable code structures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="types-of-function">Types Of Function</h2>



<p>There are two types of functions in C:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Library Functions</strong></li>



<li><strong>User Defined Functions</strong></li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-library-function">1. Library Function</h4>



<p>Library functions, also known as built-in functions, are pre-defined functions within a programming language&#8217;s package. They come with specific purposes and can be used directly without the need for you to define them. In contrast, user-defined functions require you to declare and define them before use.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pow(), sqrt(), strcmp(), strcpy() etc.
</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Advantages of C library functions</h4>



<p>Library functions, also known as built-in functions, are pre-defined functions within a programming language&#8217;s package. They come with specific purposes and can be used directly without the need for you to define them. In contrast, user-defined functions require you to declare and define them before use.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to implement
// the above approach
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
  double Number;
  Number = 49;
 
  // Computing the square root with
  // the help of predefined C
  // library function
  double squareRoot = sqrt(Number);
   
  printf("The Square root of %.2lf = %.2lf",
          Number, squareRoot);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="output">Output </h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>The Square root of 49.00 = 7.00
</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-user-defined-function">2. User Defined Function</h4>



<p>User-defined functions, often called &#8220;tailor-made functions,&#8221; are functions created by the programmer to meet specific needs. These functions can be customized and adjusted as required for a particular task. When you write a function that is specific to a particular case and is not available in any standard header file, you must declare and define your own functions according to the language&#8217;s syntax. This allows you to extend the functionality of the programming language to suit your particular requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Advantages of User-Defined Functions</h4>



<p>User-defined functions, also known as customizable functions, offer the following advantages:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> These functions can be easily modified to suit specific requirements or changes in a program.</li>



<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Code within these functions can be reused in multiple programs, promoting efficient and modular programming practices.</li>



<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> User-defined functions are typically well-structured and easy to understand, making them simpler to debug and maintain over time.</li>
</ol>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to show
// user-defined functions
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int sum(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
  int a = 30, b = 40;
  
  // function call
  int res = sum(a, b);
 
  printf("Sum is: %d", res);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Sum is: 70
</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="passing-parameters-to-functions">Passing Parameters to Functions</h2>



<p>In programming, when you invoke a function, the data values passed to it are referred to as &#8220;actual parameters&#8221; or &#8220;arguments.&#8221; In the example you provided, the values 10 and 30 are the actual parameters.</p>



<p>On the other hand, &#8220;formal parameters&#8221; are the variables and their data types specified in the function declaration. These formal parameters act as placeholders for the actual parameters when the function is called.</p>



<p><strong>1. Pass by Value</strong></p>



<p>When using the &#8220;pass by value&#8221; parameter passing method, the values from the actual parameters (the arguments) are copied into the formal function parameters. Consequently, any changes made to these formal parameters inside the function do not affect the values of the caller&#8217;s parameters. This ensures that the original data remains unchanged in the calling code, making it a safe and predictable way to work with data in functions.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to show use
// of call by value
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
void swap(int var1, int var2)
{
  int temp = var1;
  var1 = var2;
  var2 = temp;
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
  int var1 = 3, var2 = 2;
  printf("Before swap Value of var1 and var2 is: %d, %d\n",
          var1, var2);
  swap(var1, var2);
  printf("After swap Value of var1 and var2 is: %d, %d",
          var1, var2);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Before swap Value of var1 and var2 is: 3, 2
After swap Value of var1 and var2 is: 3, 2</code></pre>



<p><strong>2. Pass by Reference</strong></p>



<p>When using &#8220;pass by value&#8221; in C, the function receives copies of the caller&#8217;s data. Changes inside the function do not affect the caller&#8217;s data. To have changes reflected in the caller&#8217;s data, you need to use &#8220;pass by reference&#8221; by passing pointers to the data.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to show use of
// call by Reference
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
void swap(int *var1, int *var2)
{
  int temp = *var1;
  *var1 = *var2;
  *var2 = temp;
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
  int var1 = 3, var2 = 2;
  printf("Before swap Value of var1 and var2 is: %d, %d\n",
          var1, var2);
  swap(&amp;var1, &amp;var2);
  printf("After swap Value of var1 and var2 is: %d, %d",
          var1, var2);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Before swap Value of var1 and var2 is: 3, 2
After swap Value of var1 and var2 is: 2, 3</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-functions-in-c">Advantages of Functions in C</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reduces Repetition:</strong> Functions help avoid repeating the same code in a program, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.</li>



<li><strong>Enhances Readability:</strong> They improve code readability by breaking it into smaller, modular pieces, making it easier to understand.</li>



<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Functions can be called multiple times from different parts of the program, promoting code reuse.</li>



<li><strong>Reduces Program Size:</strong> By organizing code into functions, it reduces the overall size of the program and keeps it manageable.</li>



<li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Once a function is declared, you can use it without needing to understand its internal workings, fostering abstraction and simplifying the code.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="disadvantages-of-functions-in-c">Disadvantages of Functions in C</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cannot Return Multiple Values:</strong> C functions can return only a single value. If you need to return multiple values, you would typically use techniques like passing pointers to variables or using data structures like structs.</li>



<li><strong>Memory and Time Overhead:</strong> There is some memory and time overhead associated with function calls. This includes the allocation of stack frames for function calls and the transfer of program control between functions. However, modern compilers and systems optimize these overheads to a great extent, making them relatively minor concerns in most cases.</li>
</ol>
