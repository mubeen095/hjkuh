<p>A. Bigtable</p>



<p>B. GFS</p>



<p>C. Mapreduce</p>



<p>D. None of the options</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hdfs Is Inspired By Which Of the Following Google Projects</h2>



<p>Ans . Option B is the Correct Answer. </p>



<p>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is inspired by Google&#8217;s Google File System (GFS). Google File System is a proprietary distributed file system developed by Google to handle the storage needs of their massive data-intensive applications, and it served as an inspiration for the development of HDFS in the Apache Hadoop project.</p>



<p>HDFS shares many architectural concepts and design principles with GFS, although it is an open-source implementation tailored for the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, allowing it to be used in a wide range of applications beyond just Google&#8217;s specific use cases.</p>
