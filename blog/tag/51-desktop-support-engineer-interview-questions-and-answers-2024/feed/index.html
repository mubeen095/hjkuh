<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Desktop Support Engineer Interview Questions And Answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. What is Active Directory?</h3>



<p>Ans. <strong>Active Directory (AD):</strong> Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft. It is used to manage and organize information about network resources (such as users, computers, and printers) in a distributed network environment. AD provides authentication and authorization services, allowing administrators to control access to resources and enforce security policies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. What is DHCP and what is it used for?</h3>



<p>Ans. <strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</strong> DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network. It eliminates the need for manual IP address configuration, making it easier to manage and scale large networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. What is the scope and super scope?</h3>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> In DHCP, a scope is a range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign to devices on a subnet. It includes configuration settings such as the default gateway and DNS servers.</li>



<li><strong>Super Scope:</strong> A super scope is a collection of individual scopes that can be configured on a DHCP server. It allows a DHCP server to manage IP addresses from multiple non-contiguous scopes, providing more flexibility in addressing different subnets.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. What is DNS?</h3>



<p>Ans. <strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network. It serves as a distributed database that maintains a mapping between domain names and corresponding IP addresses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. What is forward and reverse lookup in DNS?</h3>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Forward Lookup:</strong> In a forward lookup, the DNS resolves a domain name to an IP address. For example, it translates &#8220;www.example.com&#8221; to its corresponding IP address.</li>



<li><strong>Reverse Lookup:</strong> In a reverse lookup, the DNS resolves an IP address to a domain name. For example, it translates an IP address like &#8220;192.168.1.1&#8221; to its associated domain name.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. What is ‘A’ record and what is ‘MX record’?</h3>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A Record:</strong> An &#8216;A&#8217; (Address) record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. It is used in forward lookups to associate a domain name with its corresponding IP address.</li>



<li><strong>MX Record:</strong> An &#8216;MX&#8217; (Mail Exchange) record is a type of DNS record that specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email messages on behalf of a domain. It helps route emails to the correct mail servers.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. What is the IPCONFIG command?</h3>



<p>Ans. <strong>IPCONFIG Command:</strong> The <code>ipconfig</code> command is a Windows command-line utility that provides information about the IP configuration of a computer. It can display details such as the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers for all network interfaces on the system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. What would you use to connect two computers without using switches?</h3>



<p>Ans.To connect two computers directly without using switches, you can use a crossover Ethernet cable. This type of cable allows the two computers to communicate directly without the need for an intermediary network device. You would typically connect each computer&#8217;s network interface using the crossover cable, configure their IP addresses appropriately, and establish a direct network connection.</p>



<p><strong>9. What is domain?</strong></p>



<p>Ans. A domain is a group of computers recognized by a network, managed centrally using Active Directory. Active Directory, a service by Microsoft, provides centralized authentication and authorization. Installing Active Directory configures a server to act as a domain controller, creating and managing domains within a network.</p>



<p><strong>10. Tell me if your system is infected by a virus how you will recover the data?</strong></p>



<p>Ans. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Install a new hard disk.</li>



<li>Install the latest anti-virus software on the new hard disk.</li>



<li>Install an operating system on the new hard disk and ensure it has the latest patches.</li>



<li>Connect the infected hard disk as a secondary drive.</li>



<li>Run a thorough scan using the latest anti-virus software on the infected hard drive.</li>



<li>Clean and remove any identified malware or threats.</li>



<li>Once the infected drive is clean, safely disconnect it.</li>



<li>Boot up the system using the new hard disk with the secure operating system.</li>



<li>Copy necessary files from the now-clean infected hard drive to the new system.</li>
</ol>
