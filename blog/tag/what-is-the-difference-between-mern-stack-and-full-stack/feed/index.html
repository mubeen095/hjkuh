<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-stack">What is Stack </h2>



<p>A Stack is basically a conceptual structure that is developed on the (lIFO) first out principle and consists of various homogenous structures. It involves two primary operations push and pop . We know that the top element was added to the stack and has push and pop operations. Whereas, the pop operation can remove an element from the top and the push operation can add an element to the stack. Computer memory management and programming both can use the stack notion.</p>



<p>A Stack will contain programming language and suitable technology. These will have either application stacks or technology stacks. Also, the former has a cross-disciplinary word which is available in the software development process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-full-stack-and-the-reason-to-choose-it"><strong>What Is Full Stack and the </strong>Reason to Choose it?</h2>



<p>A full-stack developer is someone who uses a bunch of tools and programming languages to work on both the front and back parts of an application or website. This whole set of technologies is called full-stack technology. A full-stack developer can handle everything from making the visible parts of a site look great (Front End) to dealing with the behind-the-scenes stuff (Back End).</p>



<p>They work on the Front End Technology (what you see on a website), Back End Development Languages (the hidden code that makes things work), Version Controlling Systems (keeping track of changes), Servers (where the website or app is hosted), APIs (ways different parts of software talk to each other), and Databases (where information is stored).</p>



<p>Full-stack developers have the freedom to create awesome user interfaces and use various technologies in the background. They start from scratch and end up with a fully functioning website or app. The full stack is made up of four important parts: Front-end, Back-end, Testing, and Mobile app. They cover everything needed to create a complete software solution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-difference-between-full-stack-and-mern-stack">Key Difference Between Full Stack And Mern Stack</h2>



<p>a.<strong>Productivity:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Full Stack development is considered more productive than MERN Stack development.</li>
</ul>



<p>b.<strong>Libraries:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A complete stack includes jQuery, LESS, and other necessary libraries.</li>



<li>MERN stack requires additional libraries for third-party support.</li>
</ul>



<p>c.<strong>Architecture:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Full Stack requires 3 Tier Web Architecture.</li>



<li>MERN stack uses Smooth UI Rendering architecture, providing a rich and easily generated user interface.</li>
</ul>



<p>d.<strong>Scalability:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MERN stack is more scalable than full-stack development.</li>



<li>Full stack development is suitable for large-scale apps, while MERN is better for niche projects like single-page applications or mobile apps.</li>
</ul>



<p>e.<strong>Development Mode of Full Stack:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Full-stack developers are well-versed in all aspects of software development, including Mobile App Development, PC Software Development, and Web Development.</li>
</ul>



<p>f.<strong>Development Mode of MERN Stack:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MERN Stack is specifically designed for web development.</li>



<li>MERN Stack developers are skilled in various aspects of JavaScript and are familiar with both back-end development frameworks (NodeJS, MongoDB, Express) and front-end frameworks (ReactJS).</li>
</ul>



<p>In summary, Full Stack development is seen as more productive, the full stack includes essential libraries, and it follows a 3 Tier Web Architecture. MERN Stack, on the other hand, is preferred for its smooth UI rendering architecture, scalability for niche projects, and suitability for smaller sample projects like single-page applications or mobile apps. Full-stack developers are experts in various aspects of software development, covering mobile app development, PC software development, web development, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Meanwhile, full stack development has few disadvantages too</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expertise Balance:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Specialized experience is often sought by employers, making full-stack developers, with skills in both front-end and back-end, less ideal when specific expertise is required due to higher salaries.</li>
</ul>



<p> 2.<strong>Challenges in Web Development:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Managing both front-end and back-end operations is demanding, requiring a strong passion for web development.</li>
</ul>



<p> 3.<strong>Staying Updated Struggle:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keeping up with trends across technologies is challenging for web developers, who already have a lot on their plate.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-mern-stock">Advantages Of Mern Stock</h2>



<p><strong>Web Development with MERN Stack:</strong></p>



<p>The Web Development Cycle covers all aspects from front-end to back-end, and MERN stack empowers developers to operate in a full-stack environment. This means they have all the tools they need for creating highly scalable apps, utilizing the latest front-end development tools and technologies.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Model View Controller (MVC):</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MERN supports the Model View Controller, ensuring a smooth development process.</li>
</ul>



<p> 2.<strong>Scalability and Adaptability:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developers using MERN appreciate its ability to scale solutions as needed.</li>



<li>It provides flexibility for crafting solutions while maintaining consistency across data centers.</li>
</ul>



<p>3.<strong>Dynamic Schema:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MERN technologies offer a configurable data model with a dynamic schema.</li>



<li>Strong command-line and GUI tools enhance the development experience.</li>
</ul>



<p>Developers find MERN stack technology to be faster, better, and well-suited for application development, making it a dynamic and adaptable choice for building modern web applications.</p>



<p><strong>Mern Stack has few disadvantages too </strong></p>



<p><strong>React Efficiency:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>React, being a library, may lead to lower productivity as it relies on multiple third-party libraries.</li>



<li>Additional work is required for React code due to frequent updates.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Applications at Scale with MERN:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MERN faces challenges when creating large projects with multiple collaborators.</li>



<li>MERN stack is well-suited for single-page apps.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Error Prevention:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MEAN stack is preferable for preventing common code faults.</li>



<li>Angular in the MEAN stack, utilizing Typescript, naturally guards against typical coding mistakes throughout the coding process.</li>



<li>React falls short in this aspect, lacking the inherent safeguards provided by Typescript.</li>
</ul>
