<p>Support and confidence are crucial terms in implementing Market Basket Analysis (MBA), which is a common technique used in retail and e-commerce to uncover associations between products that are frequently purchased together.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support:</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support is a measure of how frequently an itemset (a set of items or attributes) appears in a dataset. It indicates the proportion of transactions or records in the dataset that contain the itemset.</li>



<li>Mathematically, support for an itemset X is calculated as Support(X) = (Number of transactions containing X) / (Total number of transactions)</li>



<li>Support values typically range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating that the itemset X is present in all transactions and 0 indicating that it is not present in any transaction.</li>



<li>High support values suggest that the itemset is common in the dataset.</li>
</ul>



<p> 2. Confidence:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Confidence measures the strength of association between two itemsets, often referred to as the antecedent (X) and consequent (Y) of an association rule.</li>



<li>Confidence is calculated as the conditional probability of finding the consequent Y in a transaction given that the antecedent X is present in that transaction.</li>



<li>Mathematically, confidence for a rule X -&gt; Y is calculated as: Confidence(X -&gt; Y) = Support(X âˆª Y) / Support(X)</li>



<li>Confidence values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect association between X and Y, and 0 indicating no association.</li>



<li>High confidence values suggest that if the antecedent X is present in a transaction, there is a strong likelihood that the consequent Y will also be present.</li>
</ul>
