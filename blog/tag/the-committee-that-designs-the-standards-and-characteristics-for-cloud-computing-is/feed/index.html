<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Committee That Designs The Standards And Characteristics For Cloud Computing Is</h2>



<p>Ans. </p>



<p>The International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) is recognized for its role in shaping the standards and characteristics of cloud computing. Collaborating closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), INCITS has played a key role in defining the fundamental features of cloud computing. These characteristics encompass:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>On-demand Service</strong>: Users have the flexibility to access cloud computing resources and services whenever they require them.</li>



<li><strong>Broad Network Access</strong>: Cloud users can easily retrieve their data from a diverse array of devices, including tablets, laptops, and smartphones, as long as they are connected to the internet.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Pooling</strong>: Cloud computing platforms provide a dynamic pool of resources that can be allocated and scaled in response to user needs, ensuring efficient resource utilization.</li>



<li><strong>Rapid Elasticity</strong>: Cloud services are designed to be highly scalable, enabling users to quickly expand their cloud resources to accommodate increased data storage and processing requirements.</li>



<li><strong>Measured Service</strong>: Cloud providers implement monitoring mechanisms to track service usage, aiding in billing, resource optimization, and predictive planning.</li>
</ol>
