<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="python-applications">Python Applications</h2>



<p>Python is a beginner-friendly language. Further, It is very useful for web development and to develop many other software applications. This article has listed 10 Python Applications which are useful for developers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-10-python-applications">What are 10 Python Applications?</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-python-for-web-development">1. Python For Web Development</h2>



<p>Python&#8217;s web framework can allow the development of <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/which-of-these-web-applications-can-be-used-with-azure/" data-type="post" data-id="1523">web applications</a>. Web Developer community can include Django, Pyramid, and Flask. Flask is well-known in the developer groups. Hence, it will be easier to create and deploy complex web applications.</p>



<p>However, the recent versions of Python can give asynchronous programming support. Whereas, modern development can use this feature to create fast and high-performance web apps and APIs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-python-for-machine-learning">2. Python for Machine Learning</h2>



<p>Python libraries will allow the creation of models to forecast trends such as customer satisfaction, and projected values of stocks on the past data. Python Libraries include Scikit-Learn and Tensor-Flow.  <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions-and-answers/" data-type="post" data-id="3717">Machine learning </a>applications are medical diagnosis, statistical arbitrage, basket analysis, and sales prediction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-python-for-data-science">3. Python For Data Science</h2>



<p>There has been a rapid increase in the python&#8217;s popularity chart. It is one of the necessary skills for the data scientist. Currently, web applications, mobile applications, and several other devices will require more data. Python&#8217;s data science libraries will allow the creation of buisness insights from this data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-python-for-embedded-systems-and-io-t">4. Python For Embedded Systems and IoT</h2>



<p>Several automation products such as robotics, IoT, and kiosk applications are developed with Arduino and programmed with the help of Micropython.  Micropython is considered a lightweight version that is specially created for microcontrollers such as Arduino. Raspberry Pi is a well-known and affordable single-board computer for several web applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-python-for-computer-vision-and-image-processing">5.  Python For Computer Vision and Image Processing</h2>



<p>Open CV is well-known for capturing and processing images.<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/efficiency-empowered-data-structure/" data-type="post" data-id="298"> Image Processing algorithms</a> will take information from images, and reconstruct image and video data.  Computer vision will use image processing for face detection purposes and pattern recognition. Open CV is known as a<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/python-vs-c/" data-type="post" data-id="6873"> C++ </a>library. It&#8217;s Python Port functions for the development feature. Application areas include robotics, industrial surveillance, and automation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-python-for-job-scheduling-and-automation">6.  Python For Job Scheduling and  Automation</h2>



<p>Python is considered the first application for automating CRO(Command Run On) Jobs. Several tasks include Periodic data backups will be written in Python scripts and planned automatically with the help of<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/in-which-operating-system-we-can-use-azure-cli/" data-type="post" data-id="3256"> operating system </a>automation scripts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-python-for-artificial-intelligence">7. Python For Artificial Intelligence</h2>



<p>Python consists of inbuilt libraries and a few tools that are used for the creation of AL Algorithms. Additionally, they will provide simple and readable code and can help the developers to write complex algorithms. Some of the tools that will improve the<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/" data-type="post" data-id="78"> AI </a>Process are:</p>



<p>a. Numpy for complex data analysis.</p>



<p>b. Scipy for technical computing</p>



<p>c. Seaborn for data visualization</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-python-for-game-development">8. Python For Game Development</h2>



<p>Python has an important role in the gaming industry and their development. Popular games such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Bridge Commander, and Battlefield 2 will take advantage of Python programming. Further, popular 2D and 3D gaming libraries such as pygame, panda3D, and Cocos2D will help in the game development process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-python-for-audio-and-visual-applications">9. Python For Audio and Visual Applications</h2>



<p>The best feature of Python is audio and video applications. It consists of many libraries and tools to do the tasks easily.  An application that uses Python is Netflix, Spotify, and<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-youtube-channels/" data-type="post" data-id="6272"> YouTube</a>.  These applications are managed with the help of libraries such as Dejavu, Open Cv, Pyo, Mingus, and Scipy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-python-for-software-development">10. Python For Software development</h2>



<p>Python is considered as the best option for the software development. Some of the well-known applications are <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/free-online-digital-marketing-courses-with-certificates-by-google/" data-type="post" data-id="1195">Google</a>, Netflix, and Reddit. Additionally, their language has several features such as platform independence, high compatibility, improved code reusability, and readability.  Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are the technologies that will improve software development.</p>
