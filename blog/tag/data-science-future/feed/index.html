<p><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-eligibility-criteria/" data-type="post" data-id="5620">Data science</a>, as referred to by today&#8217;s industry professionals is the study and use of data to inform business decisions, will create new customer-facing products. Data scientists are responsible for data <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/what-is-the-future-of-data-analytics/" data-type="post" data-id="2004">analytics</a> to find new insights. They will often work with advanced machine learning models to predict future customer or market behavior based on past trends.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of what businesses hope to receive from data scientists will be expected to change. However,   data scientists will accomplish those goals that are likely to undergo substantial alterations in the years ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-data-science-have-a-future">Will Data Science Have a Future?</h2>

<p>More of a data scientist&#8217;s job is to get data ready for analysis. Now, technology will provide the sell platforms&nbsp;that will automate tasks and abstract data into low-code or no-code environments, potentially they will be able to eliminate much of the work currently done by data scientists. The data scientist title will fade into the background as more tools are becoming prevalent.</p>



<p><strong>Image Recognition</strong>: As <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/datascience-highest-package/" data-type="post" data-id="4603">companies </a>get more data, clarity will increase, especially in applications like automated vehicles which include the Teslas. For example,  a self-driving car will detect the road and when many people repeatedly drive on the same route, the system&#8217;s image of the road will become more precise, which makes the subsequent drives on the same route more comfortable.</p>



<p><strong>Health Care Advancements</strong>: A growing patient database will enable the health care system to quickly recognize deficiencies, and will help the government address emerging health crises promptly.</p>



<p><strong>Weather Forecasting</strong>: Gathering data from previous years and powerful analysis tools will allow for improved storm predictions and then, potentially saving lives and minimizing property loss.</p>



<p><strong>Fraud Detection</strong>: Algorithms and AI tools can do fraudulent transactions, and proactive measures can be taken to prevent further occurrences.</p>



<p><strong>Gaming</strong>: In video games, personalized user experiences are then crafted through extensive data collection. User habits, preferences, and dislikes will contribute to providing gaming experiences.</p>



<p><strong>Logistics</strong>: <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/which-of-the-given-languages-is-not-commonly-used-for-ai/" data-type="post" data-id="2778">AI</a> systems, <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/which-of-the-following-is-not-an-application-of-data-science/" data-type="post" data-id="1660">applications</a> such as Google Maps, provide advanced route recommendations, and future developments may address issues such as road accidents.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation Systems</strong>: The entertainment industry, exemplified by platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, benefits from extensive data collection. User watch history serves as a rich data bank, refining content suggestions based on individual preferences.</p>
