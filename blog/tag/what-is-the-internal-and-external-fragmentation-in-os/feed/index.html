<p>This article will discuss what is the internal and external fragmentation in OS. Moreover, it will also provide an idea of what fragmentation is, the main difference between internal and external fragmentation. </p>



<p>In computer systems, we deal with two types of memory waste: internal and external fragmentation. </p>



<p>Internal fragmentation happens when we allocate more memory than needed, leaving empty space. External fragmentation occurs when free memory is scattered in small pieces, making it hard to find enough space for big tasks. These concepts help us use memory better. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-fragmentation">What is Fragmentation?</h2>



<p>Simply put, fragmentation is misused for data storage and their ability might be reduced. So, the impact of fragmentation is determined by the individual fragmentation type and use of a unique storage space allocation strategy. Moreover, the ram functions to retrieve the data set (for example, file format ) which is equivalent to other systems. </p>



<p>The operating system will allow the storage of components that are stored in chunks only when a computer program wants them. Therefore, after ending a software program, it can be put into a system and moved back to the following or related following. This software can retrieve chunks for varying lengths of time and in different sizes. </p>



<p>Hence, computer programming can request and release several storage blocks during its existence. Moreover, the unused memory areas are large and continuous when a system starts. The continuous sector breaks up through time and is further utilized into smaller sections of the land. Whereas, large continuous storage blocks are very difficult to access.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fragmentation-in-os">Fragmentation in OS</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="internal-fragmentation">Internal Fragmentation</h3>



<p>This process contains a bigger memory block assigned to it. Therefore, some memory is left unused as another process cannot utilize it. Thus, the lower partition is big enough for the process and will be chosen to reduce internal fragmentation. We can also use the Best Fit Block to fix the internal fragmentation.</p>



<p> Internal fragmentation will occur when it uses less or more space than the assigned block. Hence,  When there is a mismatch between the assigned necessary memory space. This is referred to as internal fragmentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="external-fragmentation">External Fragmentation</h3>



<p>The sum of money is necessary to handle a request or house a process, however, it cannot be used as it is not contiguous. External fragmentation occurs when a segment is applied.  We know that when a process is removed from the main memory, external fragmentation will occur. In short, we can understand that external fragmentation occurs only when the memory portion allocated is of different sizes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="variations-of-fragmentation">Variations of Fragmentation</h2>



<p>Memory is divided into little blocks and fragments are inherently non -contiguous. Hence, we are unable to assign them to process. Therefore, the process gets pending and some unused blocks remain in the memory. Hence, internal and external fragmentation will be possible. </p>



<p>Internal fragmentation happens when we allocate memory for a process that can be bigger than the requested memory and will divide the physical memory into contiguous mounted-sized chunks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the space can&#8217;t be used for other processes. External fragmentation happens when there is unused RAM to fit in all the allocation requests.&nbsp;Memory is not continuous in this case. Hence, the RAM has many vacant blocks which are very small to be assigned in other applications. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fragmentation-of-operating-systems">Fragmentation of Operating Systems</h2>



<p>Processes are provided space in the computerâ€™s storage system when it is loaded. Then, this space is divided between fixed partitioning (in which the size of partitions is fixed before any process is loaded into memory) and dynamic partitioning (where the size of partitions is decided at the run time, and it is mainly according to the size of the process) (where the size of partitions is decided at the run time and it is primarily according to the size of the process).</p>



<p>Hence, the processes are removed from memory in a similar process as it was added to it, fragmenting the available free space. Therefore, we know that these primary results are tiny, underutilized fragmented memory locations and so, are too small to support usual activities.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1691399092735" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is external fragmentation in OS segmentation? </h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Segmentation partitions programs into independent modules. Process swapping breaks free memory into small pieces, causing external fragmentation.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1691399196270" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. How to overcome internal and external fragmentation in OS?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. To reduce external fragmentation, compact or shuffle memory dynamically. Assign adequately sized partitions to processes to minimize internal fragmentation.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1691399289871" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3.What is an example of internal fragmentation?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The Operating System uses a part of this RAM. Let&#8217;s suppose a process P1 with a size of 3MB arrives and is given a memory block of 4MB. As a result, the 1MB of free space in this block is unused and cannot be used to allocate memory to another process. It is known as internal fragmentation.</p>
