<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-science-vs-computer-science">Data Science Vs Computer Science</h2>



<p>This article discusses the difference between data science and computer science. Data Science and Computer Science are those two important components in the world of technology. Computer Science is all about the big picture—how computers work, coding languages, and creating software. It&#8217;s like building a playground. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Data Science zooms in on using data to find important information. It&#8217;s like discovering hidden treasures in the playground. So, Computer Science sets up the play area, and Data Science explores it to uncover cool stuff. Together, they team up to make technology better and solve important problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-computer-science">What is Computer Science?</h2>

<p>The field of computer science is rapidly evolving and has varied more than the specific job title of a computer scientist. Regardless of that, computer science jobs should have background knowledge in software engineering. The other tasks of a computer scientist will include database administration, hardware engineering, system analysis, network architecture, web development, and several other  IT roles.</p>



<p>Computer Science is like exploring the world of computers and how they do things. It&#8217;s not just about the physical machines but also about how they handle information through programs. Computer Science involves using algorithms to work with data and covers both the hardware (the actual machines) and software (programs and languages). </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a big field that includes understanding networks, the internet, and even how to make computers operate smoothly. Hence, Computer Science is all about figuring out how to design, make, and use computer systems.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Data Science is a field where information and knowledge are extracted from the data through several scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. It will be defined as a combination of various mathematical tools, algorithms, statistics, and machine-learning techniques.</p>



<p>Moreover, these are further used to find the hidden patterns and insights from the data which helps in the decision-making process. Data science contains both structured as well as unstructured data. It is linked to both data mining and big data. Data science requires studying historical trends and then using those conclusions to redefine present trends and predict future trends.</p>
