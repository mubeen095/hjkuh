<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="difference-between-class-and-structure-in-c">Difference Between Class and Structure in C++</h2>



<p>In the era of programming, We are aware of how C++ programming has evolved over time. Through this article, we are looking at the various difference between class and structure in C++. A structure will perform the same way as a class regardless of those two differences. Their major function is hiding implementation details. Hence, in short, the structure will provide its implementation details for its users. Whereas, a class won&#8217;t show its implementation details and thus will indeed restrict the programmer from accessing it. The table below represents the difference between class and structure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="class-and-structure">Class And Structure </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Class </strong></td><td><strong>Structure </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Members of the class are not revealed to everyone.</td><td>Members of the class are revealed to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>A &#8220;class&#8221; is a blueprint, and an &#8220;object&#8221; is what you create based on that blueprint.<br></td><td>In structure, use that blueprint to create an actual structure in memory, we call it an &#8220;object&#8221; or &#8220;structure instance.</td></tr><tr><td>All programming languages have default behavior even though their members are private.</td><td>In OOP languages, use <code>class</code> keywords to create a blueprint for objects with attributes and behaviors.</td></tr><tr><td><br><br>Whereas, class is responsible for grouping data.<br><br><br><br></td><td>A structure is declared using the <code>struct</code> keyword.

<div class="rank-math-list ">
<div id="faq-question-1690868952193" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Q 1. What is a structure in C++ for example?<br></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans.Structures (structs) group related variables (members) of different data types together. Example: An employee&#8217;s will include details of salary, position, experience, etc. Hence, it will be stored in one single variable using structures.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1690887859055" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Q 2. How many types of structures are there in C++?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C++, structures can have two types of members: data members (variables of different types) and member functions (normal C++ functions).</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1690887860987" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Q3.What is an array of structures in C++?<br></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. An array is a collection of data items of the same type, like int, char, float, etc. In contrast, a structure allows elements of different data types to be grouped together under a single name.</p>
