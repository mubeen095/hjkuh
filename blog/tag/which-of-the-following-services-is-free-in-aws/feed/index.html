<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Of The Following Services Is Free In AWS?</h2>



<p>Ans. All of the services such as Code deploy, code commit, code build, and code pipeline  listed above is free.</p>



<p>AWS (Amazon Web Services) does provide a Free Tier trial for 12 months to new customers, which includes a variety of free services with usage limits per month. During this 12-month trial period, customers can explore and use these services within the specified quotas/limits without incurring charges. These free services and their associated limits are intended to help users get started with AWS and understand the platform&#8217;s capabilities. It&#8217;s important to note that the AWS Free Tier may vary by region, and some services have specific usage limits. To avoid unexpected charges, it&#8217;s essential to monitor your usage and stay within the free tier limits during the trial period.</p>
