<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Of The Following Is Also Called Compute</h2>



<p>Answer: &#8220;Compute&#8221; in the context of cloud computing refers to the resources and services that handle processing tasks, such as running applications, executing code, and performing calculations. The term &#8220;compute&#8221; encompasses the virtual machines, containers, and serverless platforms that execute the code and perform computations.</p>



<p>Out of the provided options, &#8220;set of Virtual Machines instances &#8221; and &#8221; set of commodity servers &#8221; are both referred to as &#8220;Compute&#8221; resources in cloud computing. Set of Virtual Machine Instances This refers to a group of virtual machines (VMs) that are created and managed together. Virtual machines are software-based instances that mimic physical computers. They can run different operating systems and applications on a single physical server, providing flexibility and scalability for computing tasks.</p>



<p>Set of Commodity Servers Commodity servers are basic, standardized servers that are not highly specialized. A &#8220;set of commodity servers&#8221; refers to multiple low-cost servers that are used collectively to handle computing workloads. Clustering these servers can provide enhanced processing power and redundancy</p>



<p>These resources provide the computing power needed to run applications and perform tasks in the cloud environment.</p>



<p>So, the correct answer is a set of Virtual Machines.</p>
