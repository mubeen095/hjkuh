<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fseek-vs-rewind-in-c">Fseek() Vs Rewind() In C</h2>



<p>In C programming, efficient file manipulation is crucial for effective data handling. Two essential functions for file positioning are <code>fseek()</code> and <code>rewind()</code>. While both are employed to navigate within files, they differ in their specific applications and behaviors. Understanding the distinctions between <code>fseek()</code> and <code>rewind()</code> is fundamental for programmers seeking precise control over file operations. This discussion will delve into the unique characteristics and use cases of these functions, shedding light on when and how to employ them for optimal file management in C.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fseek-function">fseek() Function</h2>



<p>In the realm of C programming, effective file handling is a cornerstone of data manipulation. The <code>fseek()</code> function plays a pivotal role in this domain by providing a means to set the file position indicator to a specified offset from a defined origin within a file. This capability empowers programmers with precise control over file navigation, enabling them to efficiently access and manipulate data at specific locations within a file. As we explore the intricacies of <code>fseek()</code>, we&#8217;ll uncover its nuances and delve into its applications, illuminating its role in optimizing file operations in C.</p>



<p>Syntax</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin);
</code></pre>



<p>Parameter</p>



<p>In the context of file manipulation in C, the <code>fseek()</code> function serves as a versatile tool, primarily revolving around three crucial parameters: <code>stream</code>, <code>offset</code>, and <code>origin</code>. The <code>stream</code> is essentially a pointer to the FILE stream, representing the file under consideration. The <code>offset</code> parameter assumes significance as it determines the number of bytes by which the file position indicator should be adjusted. However, what adds a layer of flexibility to this function is the <code>origin</code> parameter, which defines the reference point for the offset calculation. This can take one of three values:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SEEK_SET:</strong> Setting the origin at the beginning of the file.</li>



<li><strong>SEEK_CUR:</strong> Establishing the origin at the current position of the file pointer.</li>



<li><strong>SEEK_END:</strong> Placing the origin at the end of the file.</li>
</ol>



<p>Understanding the interplay between these parameters is pivotal for harnessing the full potential of <code>fseek()</code> in navigating and manipulating files with precision in C.</p>



<p><strong>Return Value</strong></p>



<p>It will  returns 0 if successful, and a non-zero value if an error occurs.</p>



<p><strong>Rewind() Function</strong></p>



<p>rewind() is a function which will move the file pointer to the beginning of the file stream.</p>



<p>Syntax</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>void rewind(FILE *stream);
</code></pre>



<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>stream</strong>: It refers to  the pointer to the file stream</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Return Value</strong></p>



<p>It won&#8217;t return any value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="difference-between-fseek-and-rewind-in-c">Difference between fseek() and rewind() in C</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Syntax:&nbsp;</strong>int&nbsp;<strong>fseek</strong>(FILE *<em>stream</em>, long&nbsp;<em>offset</em>, int&nbsp;<em>origin</em>);</td><td><strong>Syntax:</strong>void&nbsp;<strong>rewind</strong>(FILE *<em>stream</em>);</td></tr><tr><td>It will  returns 0 if it was successful, and a non-zero value if there is any error .</td><td>It won&#8217;t return any value.</td></tr><tr><td>The stream error indicator won&#8217;t be  cleared.</td><td>The stream error indicator will be cleared.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;fseek(file, 10, SEEK_SET);It moves the file pointer 10 bytes from the beginning of the file.</td><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;rewind(file);It moves the file pointer to the beginning of the file.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="which-should-be-preferred">Which should be preferred?</h2>



<p>In the C programming world, we have two tools for managing files: <code>fseek()</code> and <code>rewind()</code>. Let&#8217;s keep it simple:</p>



<p><code>fseek()</code> is like a GPS for files. It helps us move to a specific point in a file. We use it by telling it how many steps (bytes) to take and from where to start &#8211; either from the beginning, where we currently are, or from the end of the file.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <code>rewind()</code> is more straightforward. It&#8217;s like pressing a reset button for the file. It always takes us back to the beginning of the file, no matter where we were. This simplicity makes it a handy tool when we just want to start fresh. Both are useful, but <code>fseek()</code> gives us more control, while <code>rewind()</code> is a quick way to go back to the start.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(void)fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)
</code></pre>



<p>except that the error indicator for the stream will  also be  cleared.</p>



<p>This following code example will provide  the file position indicator of an input stream back to the beginning using rewind(). However, it doesn&#8217;t have any method to check whether the rewind() was successful.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>

int main()
{
    FILE* fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
 
    if (fp == NULL) {
        /* Handle open error */
    }
 
    /* Do some processing with file*/
 
    /* no way to check if rewind is successful */
    rewind(fp);
 
    /* Do some more precessing with file */
 
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>In the code given above , fseek() will be  used instead of rewind() to see if the operation  was successful.</p>



<p><strong>The following lines of code can be used in place of rewind(fp);&nbsp;</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>if ( fseek(fp, 0L, SEEK_SET) != 0 ) {
/* Handle repositioning error */
}

</code></pre>

<div id="faq-question-1700215665222" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is the difference between rewind and fseek in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C programming, both <code>fseek()</code> and <code>rewind()</code> can take us to the beginning of a file. However, there&#8217;s a small but important difference. <code>rewind()</code> not only moves the pointer but also clears any error signals. On the other hand, <code>fseek()</code> doesn&#8217;t clear errors, and it tells us if it succeeded or not.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2.What does rewind () do in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C programming, <code>rewind()</code> is like a quick way to start reading a file again. When you use <code>rewind()</code>, it takes the file pointer and puts it back at the beginning of the file. This means you can read the data from the start once more. It&#8217;s like hitting a refresh button for the file, making it ready to be read from the beginning again.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What is the fseek function in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C programming, the <code>fseek()</code> function is like a file navigator. It helps us move to a different spot in a file. So, if you want to read or write from a specific place, <code>fseek()</code> is your go-to tool. Once you use <code>fseek()</code>, the next thing you do with the file will happen from the new spot you chose. If you opened the file for both reading and writing, the next action can be either reading or writing. It gives you control over where your next file operation happens.</p>
