<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-pro-mern-stack">3. Pro MERN Stack</h2>



<p>Full Stack Web App Development with Mongo, Express, React, and Node</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vrozt03WL._SL500_.jpg" alt="Book Cover of Vasan Subramanian - Pro MERN Stack: Full Stack Web App Development with Mongo, Express, React, and Node"/></figure>



<p>The  book &#8220;Pro MERN Stack&#8221; is focused on equipping developers and architects with the skills needed to build a modern web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key points mentioned in the provided text:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Complete Stack Components:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces).</li>



<li><strong>Backend:</strong> MongoDB (NoSQL database), Express (web application server framework), Node.js (JavaScript runtime on the server side).</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Additional Tools Covered:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>React Router: For managing navigation in React applications.</li>



<li>React-Bootstrap: A React-based UI framework for designing responsive and consistent UIs.</li>



<li>Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React for state management.</li>



<li>Babel: A JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features.</li>



<li>webpack: A module bundler for JavaScript applications.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Focus on React:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>While the book covers the entire MERN stack, a significant portion is devoted to React.</li>



<li>Emphasis on understanding React, the React Way, and maximizing its potential.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Comparison with MEAN Stack:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC).</li>



<li>React competes indirectly with AngularJS and is considered as part of the MERN stack.</li>



<li>React is described as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (the &#8220;View&#8221; part) rather than a full-fledged MVC framework.</li>



<li>React is seen as a replacement for AngularJS in the MERN stack.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Discover the details of React and how to leverage it effectively.</li>



<li>Gain basic knowledge of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app.</li>



<li>Work with complementary tools such as React-Bootstrap and React Router.</li>



<li>Learn how to use tools required for building JavaScript-based Single Page Applications (SPAs).</li>



<li>Tie all the components together to build a complete web application.</li>

<li>Developers and architects with prior experience in web app stacks other than the MERN stack.</li>



<li>Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.</li>
</ul>



<p>In summary, &#8220;Pro MERN Stack&#8221; aims to provide a comprehensive guide for building modern web applications using the MERN stack, with a significant emphasis on React and its associated tools. The book is tailored for developers and architects with prior web development experience.</p>
