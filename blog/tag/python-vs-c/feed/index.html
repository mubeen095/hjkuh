<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="python-vs-c">Python vs C++</h2>



<p>Python and C++ are well-known and general-purpose programming languages. Both of the languages have Object Oriented Programming. Even though they have many differences. Check out this article to learn more about the Key differences between Python and C++.</p>



<p>C ++ language is a middle-level, case-sensitive, and object-oriented programming language. The founder of C++ is Bjarne Stroustrup at the Bell Labs. It is also an independent programming language that will perform on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.  Whereas, python is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It is used in several fields such as Web development, Machine Learning, and other software development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-c">What is C++</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/c-programming-language-tutorial/" data-type="post" data-id="1719">C++ </a>is considered a high-level, general-purpose programming language and was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup. The language has rapidly changed over time. However, modern C ++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features. Several technologies that work in libraries in Python have C++ Code.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="c-example">C++ Example</h3>



<p>We can learn the syntax of C++ with the help of an example provided below:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int a, b;
   cout &lt;&lt; "Enter The value for variable a \n";
   cin &gt;&gt; a;
   cout &lt;&lt; "Enter The value for variable b";
   cin &gt;&gt; b;
   cout &lt;&lt; "The value of a is "&lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "and" &lt;&lt; b;
   return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Here, we are providing input for 2 <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/variable-length-arguments-for-macros/" data-type="post" data-id="3327">variables </a>&#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; from the user with the help of the keyword and the data will be shown on the console.</p>



<p><strong>Output</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Enter The value for variable a
10
Enter The value for variable b
20
The value of a is 10 and 20</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/what-does-0-mean-in-this-python-string/" data-type="post" data-id="3237">Python</a> is well known for its high-level, interpreted programming language. It was introduced by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. So, python is an object-oriented programming language and consists of a library that can allow the implementation of several programs and algorithms. The object-oriented approach and language constructs will help the programmers write, logical code for several projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-of-python">Example Of Python</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>a = int(input("Enter value for a"))
b = int(input("Enter value for b"))

print("The number you have entered for a is ", a)
print("The number you have entered for b is ", b)</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Enter value for a 10
Enter value for b 20

The number you have entered for a is 10
The number you have entered for b is 20</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-difference-between-c-and-python">Key Difference between C++ and Python</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Parameters</td><td>Python </td><td>C++</td></tr><tr><td>Syntax</td><td>Python consists of short-hand syntax and several short-hand structural iterators. A few of the short-hand syntaxes are very confusing. However, everything in Python is very complex.</td><td>In contrast, C++ has an inflexible stiff learning curve and several predefined syntaxes and structures.</td></tr><tr><td>Code </td><td>It has fewer lines of code.</td><td> C++ has long lines of code.</td></tr><tr><td>Speed</td><td>Python is slower because of its use as an interpreter and will decide the data type at any run time.</td><td>Comparatively, C++ is much faster</td></tr><tr><td>Nature </td><td>Python is dynamically typed. </td><td>C++ is statically typed</td></tr><tr><td>Compilation</td><td>It is interpreted.</td><td>Whereas, C++ is precompiled.</td></tr><tr><td>Efficiency</td><td>Python has specialized formatting.</td><td>It has a C-like Syntax, powerful OOP features, and operator overload.</td></tr><tr><td>Functions </td><td>Python functions don&#8217;t have restrictions regarding the argument type and the type of the return value.</td><td>But, C++ will accept amd return the value which they have already defined.</td></tr><tr><td>Popularity </td><td> Python consists of a huge community support. Beginners and novice programmers will prefer python to work on.</td><td>In contrast, it has a following online. However, only the experienced people will prefer C++</td></tr><tr><td>Scope of Variable</td><td>Variables are available outside the loop.</td><td>In C++, variables are very limited and is within the loops.</td></tr><tr><td>Extension</td><td>Python Programs are saved in the .py extension. </td><td> It is saved in the .cpp extension.</td></tr><tr><td>Application Domain</td><td>Some of the Python  application areas are  Web development, data analysis, and scientific computations.</td><td>Some of the C++ application fields include Game development, and embedded systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Rapid  Prototyping</td><td>In Python, rapid prototyping can be done with the help of easy project setup and interpreter.</td><td> In C++, Rapid prototyping will be done. Whereas, project setup is very complicated and live interpreted through the IRC bot.</td></tr><tr><td>Garbage Collection</td><td>It will allow garbage collection.</td><td>However, it won&#8217;t support the garbage collection.</td></tr><tr><td>Installation On windows</td><td>Python is very difficult to download on  Windows.</td><td>Comparatively, C++  is very easy to download.</td></tr><tr><td>Variable declaration</td><td>In Python, variables are mostly defined by writing their name with the datatype.</td><td>In C++, it is required to mention the data type while declaring the data type.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Summing up, this article talks about the difference between Python and C++. Python is a very beginner-friendly language and C++ is preferred  by experienced people.</p>
