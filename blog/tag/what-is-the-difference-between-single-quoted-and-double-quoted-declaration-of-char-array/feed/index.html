<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-1-double-quoted-declaration-of-char-array">Example 1- Double Quoted Declaration of Char Array</h2>



<p>In C and C++, when a character array is initialized with a double-quoted string and the array size is not specified, the compiler automatically allocates one extra space for the string terminator <code>'\0'</code>. This is essential for correctly representing and manipulating strings in C and C++. This program will print 6 as output.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main() 
{ 
  // size of arr&#91;] is 6 as it is '\0' terminated  
  char arr&#91;] = "Hello"; 
  
  printf("%lu", sizeof(arr)); 
  
  return 0; 
} </code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>6</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-2-double-quoted-declaration-of-char-array">Example 2-Double Quoted Declaration of Char Array</h2>



<p>In C, specifying an array size of 5 in the above program is valid, and the program will work without any warning or error. The compiler will allocate exactly 5 characters for the array to hold &#8216;H&#8217;, &#8216;e&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217;, &#8216;o&#8217; without the null terminator. The <code>sizeof</code> operator will correctly return 5 in this case.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>

// Works in C, but compilation error in C++ 
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main() 
{ 
  // arr&#91;] is not terminated with '\0' 
  // and its size is 5 
  char arr&#91;5] = "Hello";  
    
  printf("%lu", sizeof(arr)); 
    
  return 0; 
} </code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>5</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-3-single-quoted-declaration-of-char-array">Example 3- Single Quoted Declaration of char Array</h2>



<p>When a character array is initialized with a comma-separated list of characters, and the array size is not specified, the compiler does not automatically create extra space for the string terminator <code>'\0'</code>. Instead, the compiler allocates only enough space for the characters provided in the initialization list.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main() 
{ 
  // arr&#91;] is not terminated with '\0'  
  // and its size is 5  
  char arr&#91;]= {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};  
  
  printf("%lu", sizeof(arr)); 
  
  return 0; 
} </code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>5</code></pre>

<div id="faq-question-1697092482539" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted declarations of char array in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C and C++, single quotes (<code>'</code>) represent single characters and double quotes (&#8220;) represent string literals. When you use a string literal &#8216;x&#8217;, it&#8217;s a two-character array containing the character <code>'x'</code> and a null terminator <code>'\0'</code>.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1697092727708" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. What is the difference between single and double quotes in programming?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C and C++, you can include single quotes in double-quoted strings and double quotes in single-quoted strings without escaping them. If you want to include the same type of quotation marks within a string, you need to escape them with a backslash.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1697092736202" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What is the difference between char * array and char array in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C and C++:<br /><code>char[]</code> is a fixed-size character array with direct indexing.<br /><code>char*</code> is a character pointer that references a memory location, providing flexibility in size and data access.</p>
