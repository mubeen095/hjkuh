<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Mvc Interview Questions And Answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Purpose of the Model in MVC:</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Model in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern represents the application&#8217;s data and business logic.</li>



<li>It is responsible for managing data, processing business rules, and interacting with the database.</li>
</ul>



<p>2.<strong>Role of the View in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The View is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interface interactions.</li>



<li>It displays information from the Model and sends user input back to the Controller for processing.</li>
</ul>



<p>3.<strong>Role of the Controller in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Controller manages user input, processes it (along with data from the Model), and updates the View accordingly.</li>



<li>It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user requests and updating the application state.</li>
</ul>



<p>4.<strong>Advantages of Using the MVC Pattern:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Clear separation of application logic, user interface, and data management.</li>



<li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Components (Model, View, Controller) can be developed and tested independently.</li>



<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Components can be reused in different parts of the application.</li>



<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Easier maintenance and updates due to the modular and organized structure.</li>
</ul>



<p>5.<strong>Flow of Data in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>User interacts with the View.</li>



<li>View sends user input to the Controller.</li>



<li>Controller processes input, interacts with the Model, and updates the View.</li>



<li>View displays updated data to the user.</li>



<li>This cycle continues based on user interactions.</li>
</ul>



<p>6.<strong>Differences Between ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Web Forms:</strong> Event-driven, controls with server-side state, less control over HTML, follows a page-centric approach.</li>



<li><strong>MVC:</strong> Separation of concerns, full control over HTML, supports test-driven development, follows an action-centric approach.</li>
</ul>



<p>7.<strong>Data Flow Between View and Controller in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>User interacts with the View (e.g., form submission).</li>



<li>View sends data to the Controller.</li>



<li>Controller processes data, updates the Model if needed, and returns a response.</li>



<li>View displays the updated information to the user.</li>
</ul>



<p>8.<strong>Purpose of ViewBag in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><code>ViewBag</code> is a dynamic property that allows passing data from the Controller to the View.</li>



<li>It is useful for sending small amounts of data between the Controller and the View without using strongly-typed models.</li>
</ul>



<p>9.<strong>Handling Form Submissions in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a form in the View with appropriate HTML helpers.</li>



<li>Submit the form to an action method in the Controller.</li>



<li>Controller processes form data, performs necessary actions, and updates the Model or View.</li>



<li>Use model binding to simplify handling form data in the Controller.</li>
</ul>



<p>10.<strong>Purpose of Routing in MVC:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Routing is the process of mapping URLs to Controller actions.</li>



<li>It helps determine which Controller and action should handle a particular URL request.</li>



<li>Enables creating clean and user-friendly URLs for different parts of the application.</li>
</ul>
