<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AWS Interview Questions With Answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services):</strong><br>AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage options, networking, databases, machine learning, analytics, security, and more. AWS allows businesses and individuals to access and use computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>



<li><strong>Components of AWS:</strong><br>AWS is composed of numerous services. Some key components include:</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):</strong> Virtual servers in the cloud.</li>



<li><strong>S3 (Simple Storage Service):</strong> Object storage for the web.</li>



<li><strong>RDS (Relational Database Service):</strong> Managed relational databases.</li>



<li><strong>Lambda:</strong> Serverless computing service.</li>



<li><strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):</strong> Networking service to create isolated environments.</li>



<li><strong>IAM (Identity and Access Management):</strong> Security service for managing users and their access.</li>
</ul>



<p>  3.<strong>Key-pairs:</strong><br>Ans.Key-pairs in AWS are used for secure access to EC2 instances. It involves a public key, which is placed on the instance, and a private key that is kept secure. The private key is used to authenticate and securely connect to the EC2 instance.</p>



<p>4.<strong>S3 (Simple Storage Service):</strong><br>Ans.S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is commonly used for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web. S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.</p>



<p>5.<strong>Pricing Models for EC2 Instances:</strong><br>Ans.EC2 instances are billed based on various pricing models, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>On-Demand Instances:</strong> Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no upfront cost.</li>



<li><strong>Reserved Instances:</strong> Provides a significant discount in exchange for a commitment to a one- or three-year term.</li>



<li><strong>Spot Instances:</strong> Allows you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at potentially lower prices.</li>



<li><strong>Dedicated Hosts:</strong> Physical servers dedicated for your use, offering additional visibility and control.</li>
</ul>



<p>6.<strong>AWS Lambda:</strong><br>Ans.AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and executes code in response to triggers, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table, or HTTP requests via the API Gateway.</p>



<p>7.<strong>Number of Buckets in S3:</strong><br>Ans.In Amazon S3, you can theoretically create an unlimited number of buckets per AWS account. However, there are practical limitations, and AWS recommends keeping the number of buckets to a reasonable minimum for easier management.</p>



<p>8.<strong>Cross Region Replication:</strong><br>Ans.Cross Region Replication (CRR) is a feature in Amazon S3 that allows you to replicate objects across different AWS regions. This can be used for disaster recovery, low-latency access to objects, and compliance requirements.</p>



<p>9.<strong>CloudFront:</strong><br>Ans.Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally. It integrates with other Amazon Web Services products to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute content to end-users with low latency and high data transfer speeds.</p>



<p><strong>10.  Regions and Availability Zones in aws</strong></p>



<p>Ans. Regions in AWS are separate geographic areas, like US East or Asia Pacific, each containing multiple availability zones (AZs). Availability zones are individual data centers within a region, isolated for fault tolerance. Users interact with the cloud through services provided by the cloud provider, deploying resources across AZs for high availability. Data centers house components like servers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers, enabling users to run applications and services in a secure and scalable manner. The design ensures redundancy, reliability, and optimal performance.</p>
