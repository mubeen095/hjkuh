<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="multithreading-in-c">Multithreading In C</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-a-thread"><strong>What is a Thread?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A thread is like a mini-sequence of actions inside a bigger task. Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes because they share some similarities with processes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-differences-between-process-and-thread"><strong>What are the differences between process and thread?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Threads aren&#8217;t independent like processes; they share code, data, and OS resources. However, each thread has its own program counter, registers, and stack space, much like processes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-multithreading"><strong>Why Multithreading?</strong></h2>



<p>Threads are a helpful way to make applications work better together. Think of them like different tasks happening at the same time. For example, in a web browser, each open tab can be a separate task or thread. Programs like Microsoft Word also use threads to do different jobs, like formatting text or handling inputs.</p>



<p>Threads are faster than processes for a few reasons:</p>



<p>1) Creating threads is quick.</p>



<p>2) Switching between threads is fast.</p>



<p>3) Stopping threads is easy.</p>



<p>4) Threads can talk to each other quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-we-write-multithreading-muprograms-in-c">Can we write multithreading Muprograms in C?</h2>



<p>Multithreading won&#8217;t be supported by the language standard. POSIX Threads (or Pthreads) is considered as a POSIX standard for threads. Moreover, the execution of pthread will be available with gcc compiler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="c-program-to-illustrate-the-use-of-pthread-basic-functions">C Program to illustrate the use of pthread basic functions</h2>



<p>The program given below can only compile with the C compilers along with the pthread library.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>C
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;  //Header file for sleep(). man 3 sleep for details. 
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt; 
  
// A normal C function that is executed as a thread  
// when its name is specified in pthread_create() 
void *myThreadFun(void *vargp) 
{ 
    sleep(1); 
    printf("Printing Skillvertex from Thread \n"); 
    return NULL; 
} 
   
int main() 
{ 
    pthread_t thread_id; 
    printf("Before Thread\n"); 
    pthread_create(&amp;thread_id, NULL, myThreadFun, NULL); 
    pthread_join(thread_id, NULL); 
    printf("After Thread\n"); 
    exit(0); 
}</code></pre>



<p>In the main() function, we create a variable called thread_id, which is of type pthread_t—an integer used to identify the thread. After declaring thread_id, we use the pthread_create() function to make a new thread.</p>



<p>The pthread_create() function takes 4 arguments:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The first argument is a pointer to thread_id, and this function sets its value.</li>



<li>The second argument specifies attributes. If it&#8217;s NULL, default attributes will be used.</li>



<li>The third argument is the name of the function to be executed for the new thread.</li>



<li>The fourth argument is used to pass arguments to the function, in this case, myThreadFun.</li>
</ol>



<p>The pthread_join() function is like wait() for processes. It makes the calling thread wait until the specified thread, identified by the first argument, finishes its work.</p>



<p><strong>How to compile above program?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inorder to compile a multithreaded program with the help of gcc, we have to connect with the threads library. The command given below is used to compile the program.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gfg@ubuntu:~/$ gcc multithread.c -lpthread
gfg@ubuntu:~/$ ./a.out
Before Thread
Printing GeeksQuiz from Thread 
After Thread
gfg@ubuntu:~/$ </code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-c-program-to-show-multiple-threads-with-the-global-and-static-variable">A C Program to show multiple threads with the global and static  variable</h2>



<p>We know that the global and static variables can share data segments. Global and static variables will be stored in the data segment.The example given below will illustrate the same.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt; 
  
// Let us create a global variable to change it in threads 
int g = 0; 
  
// The function to be executed by all threads 
void *myThreadFun(void *vargp) 
{ 
    // Store the value argument passed to this thread 
    int *myid = (int *)vargp; 
  
    // Let us create a static variable to observe its changes 
    static int s = 0; 
  
    // Change static and global variables 
    ++s; ++g; 
  
    // Print the argument, static and global variables 
    printf("Thread ID: %d, Static: %d, Global: %d\n", *myid, ++s, ++g); 
} 
int main() 
{ 
    int i; 
    pthread_t tid; 
  
    // Let us create three threads 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) 
        pthread_create(&amp;tid, NULL, myThreadFun, (void *)&amp;tid); 
  
    pthread_exit(NULL); 
    return 0; 
}
  </code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gfg@ubuntu:~/$ gcc multithread.c -lpthread
gfg@ubuntu:~/$ ./a.out
Thread ID: 3, Static: 2, Global: 2
Thread ID: 3, Static: 4, Global: 4
Thread ID: 3, Static: 6, Global: 6
gfg@ubuntu:~/$ </code></pre>



<p>Please note that the above example is simple and used to illustrate how threads work. Accessing a global variable in a thread is usually not recommended. What if thread 2 has priority over thread 1 and thread 1 needs to change the variable? In real-world scenarios, if multiple threads need to access a global variable, it&#8217;s better to use a mutex for safe access.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1700732287181" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is multithreading in C language?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Multithreading in C means using multiple threads within a single process, where each thread serves a distinct function. It allows concurrent operation, enabling multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. Additionally, multithreading helps minimize CPU resource consumption.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1700732295928" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. Does C allow multithreading?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The Microsoft C/C++ compiler (MSVC) offers support for building multithreaded applications. It&#8217;s beneficial to use more than one thread when your application has to execute resource-intensive operations that might otherwise make the user interface unresponsive.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1700732302098" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What is multithreading also called?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans.Concurrency is frequently used interchangeably with multithreading. Multitasking enables multiple threads to run simultaneously.</p>
