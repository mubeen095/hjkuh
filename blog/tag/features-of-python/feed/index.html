<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="python-features">Python features</h2>



<p>Due to the advanced technology, programming skills are necessary for all non-developer jobs. Hence, it is required to develop a simple programming language that will be more easy to learn with the fast edit cycles and development.  Therefore, we know that Python is the language that has all these requirements.  In this article, we have given the 10 key features of Python.</p>



<p>Moreover,  Python is one of the top programming languages of 2020, as stated by the TIOBE Programming Community Index. It is growing rapidly because of fields such as AI, data mining, and numerical computing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-10-key-features-of-python">What are the 10 Key Features Of Python?</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-python-is-easy-to-learn">1. Python is Easy to Learn</h2>



<p>This feature is the main reason for the python becoming popular. It consists of a limited set of<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/generics-keyword-in-c/" data-type="post" data-id="3708"> keywords. </a>The features of Python include simple syntax, usage of indentation to ignore the curly brackets and dynamic typing. Even though, it doesn&#8217;t involve the declaration of<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/static-variables-in-c/" data-type="post" data-id="3029"> variable</a>s it can further allow a beginner to learn Python more easily and quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-python-is-interpreted-based">2. Python is Interpreted  Based</h2>



<p>We know that <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/c-programming-language-tutorial/" data-type="post" data-id="1719">programming languages</a> are compiler-based or interpreted-based. The instructions for any programming languages will be translated into machine code for the execution process by the processor.</p>



<p>In Compiler, a machine language version of the entire source of the program will be created, This can fail if a single error statement occurs.  Due to this, this process is very difficult for beginners. Whereas, the other C family languages such as C, C++, Java, and C Sharp are <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/difference-between-assembler-compiler-and-interpreter/" data-type="post" data-id="336">compiler-based.</a></p>



<p>Python is considered an interpreted-based language. It will take one line of code from the source code. Further, they will convert it into the machine code and then execute it. The code will be executed before the error is detected. Due to this feature, it is very easy to debug the program and will be beneficial for beginner-level programmers.  It is also referred to as a beginner-friendly language.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-python-is-interactive">3. Python is Interactive&#8217;</h2>



<p>The Standard Python distribution consists of an interactive shell that can perform on the principle of REPL ((Read – Evaluate – Print – Loop).  Further, this shell will show a Python prompt &gt;&gt;&gt;. Hence, it is possible to type a type valid Python expression and click Enter. </p>



<p>In Python, when you type and run a line of code, the interpreter quickly processes and executes it. Right away, it shows you the result and gives you the prompt again, ready for you to enter the next command or line of code. This makes it easy to work with Python code interactively, seeing the outcomes immediately.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2*3+1
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello World")
Hello World</code></pre>



<p> Note: Before writing a program, you can check out some small code snippets. This interactive mode can be used to know more about the library and will test out the functionality.&#8217;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-python-is-multi-paradigm">4. Python is Multi-Paradigm</h2>



<p>We know that in a <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/mern-stack-full-project/" data-type="post" data-id="4231">Python Project</a>, whether it&#8217;s a number, text, or <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/variadic-functions-in-c/" data-type="post" data-id="2561">function</a> is considered an object. It has an object orientation which will object as an imperative or procedural language. </p>



<p>Python has several functionality which will be similar to functional programming. The third-party tools are also created to help other programming paradigms like aspect-oriented and logic programming.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-pythons-standard-library">5. Python&#8217;s Standard Library</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-libraries-in-python/" data-type="post" data-id="4685">Python library</a> consists of a few keywords such as thirty-five. <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/software-engineer-salary/" data-type="post" data-id="445">Python Software </a>has a standard library along with modules and packages. Additionally, it has an out of box support for programming such as serialization, data compression, internet data handling, etc. It is well-known for the batteries-included approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-python-is-open-source-and-cross-platform">6. Python is Open Source and Cross-Platform</h2>



<p>We can install the Python standard distribution from their website without any inconvenience. Further, install the pre-compiled binaries for the several operating system platforms. The source code is available free of cost and can be accessible under the open source category.</p>



<p>Python software will be shared under the Python Software Foundation License. It also has a BSD-style permissive software license and is very compatible with GNU GPL (General Public License)</p>



<p>So, Python is considered as a cross-platform language. Pre-compiled binaries are accessible for several operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android OS. This reference implementation of Python is known as CPython. We can install the source code and can compile it for the OS platform.</p>



<p>In Python, before your program runs, it goes through two steps. First, it&#8217;s turned into a middleman code called &#8220;byte code.&#8221; This code isn&#8217;t tied to a specific computer system. Then, a virtual machine in the Python interpreter reads and runs this byte code.</p>



<p>This two-step process is why Python works well on different operating systems. You can easily move a Python program from one system to another without a lot of fuss. It&#8217;s handy when you want your code to be flexible </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-python-for-gui-applications">7. Python For GUI Applications</h2>



<p>Tkinter is referred to as Python&#8217;s standard distribution along with a good graphics library. The Python Port with a GUI toolkit is known as TCL. This can allow you to create attractive user-friendly <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-applications/" data-type="post" data-id="6199">GUI applications </a>in Python. GUI Toolkit is written in C/C++. Several C ++ scripts are converted into Python. Examples include PyQt, WxWidgets, PySimpleGUI, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-pythons-database-connectivity">8. Python&#8217;s Database Connectivity</h2>



<p>Most of the database types will use the backend with the support of the Python application.DB-API is referred to as a specifications set for database driver software to allow the python to communicate with the relational database. Python will work with several third-party libraries such as NoSQL databases like MongoDB.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-python-is-extensible">9. Python is Extensible</h2>



<p>Extensibility is referred to as the function to include new features. CPython is mostly scripted in C. Anyone can write programs in C and can be included in the Python Library.</p>



<p>There are also other versions of Python, like Jython (made in Java) and IPython (made in C#). This means you can bring in new features using Java for Jython and C# for IPython.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-pythons-active-developer-community">10. Python&#8217;s Active Developer Community</h2>



<p>Several developers will communicate through online forums and conferences due to the popularity of Python and its open-source nature. Its software Foundation has an important member base that has a goal to &#8220;Promote, Protect, and Advance the Python Programming Language.</p>



<p>Several Companies will use Google, Microsoft, and Meta will take advantage of Python for preparing documentation and other resources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="additional-features">Additional Features</h2>



<p>a. It can be incorporated with the <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/c-program-to-delete-a-file/" data-type="post" data-id="3630">C,</a> C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p>



<p>b. It can function as a scripting language</p>



<p>c.  Python can help the functional and structured programming methods such as OOP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Summing up, this article has mentioned the key features of the Python programming language. Its ability to learn easily, readability, interactive mode, GUI Programming, and many others are included in this. Students who are learning Python can get a clear understanding of the features after reading this.</p>
