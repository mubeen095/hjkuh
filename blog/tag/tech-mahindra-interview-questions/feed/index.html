<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-tech-mahindra-interview-questions-2024">18 Tech Mahindra Interview Questions 2024</h2>



<p>Candidates preparing for the Tech Mahindra Interview can refer to the Top 18 questions below. The most commonly asked questions in the Tech Mahindra Interview questions and answers are here. Read the interview questions carefully and ace the Tech Mahindra Interview on the first attempt.</p>



<p><strong>1. What exactly do you mean by Function Overloading?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans</strong>. Function Overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows multiple functions to have the same name but with different arguments. This means you can have several functions with the same name but different parameter lists. When a function name is used for several complex tasks, it&#8217;s called function overloading.</p>



<p> The function name must be the same, but the parameters are different. Polymorphism, a feature in C++, enables function overloading, allowing functions to perform complex tasks based on their arguments.</p>



<p><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Explain the difference between #include &lt;file&gt; and #include &#8220;file&#8221;.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans</strong>. The main difference between <code>#include &lt;file&gt;</code> and <code>#include "file"</code> is where the preprocessor looks for the included file. With <code>#include "file"</code>, the preprocessor searches the same directory as the file containing the directive. This is often used for including custom header files that you create. On the other hand, <code>#include &lt;file&gt;</code> makes the preprocessor look in the directories specified by the IDE or compiler, which are usually where standard library files are located. This method is commonly used to include standard library headers.</p>



<p><strong>3. Explain the difference between call by reference and call by value.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Call by Reference: In this method, the formal and actual parameters refer to the same memory location. So, any changes within the function affect the parameters in the calling code.</p>



<p>Call by Value: In this method, the values of the actual parameters are copied to the formal parameters. These two sets of parameters are stored in different memory locations. Therefore, any changes made within the function do not affect the actual parameters in the calling code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Aspect </td><td>Call by Reference </td><td>Call by Value </td></tr><tr><td>Memory Location</td><td>Formal and actual parameters refer to the same memory location.</td><td>Formal and actual parameters are stored in different memory locations.</td></tr><tr><td>Parameter Changes</td><td>Changes within the function affect the actual parameters in the calling code.</td><td>Changes within the function do not affect the actual parameters in the calling code.</td></tr><tr><td>Use Case</td><td>It is required when you need the function to modify the actual parameters.</td><td>It is beneficial when you want to protect the actual parameters from being modified.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance </td><td>It is more efficient for large data structures as no copying is involved.</td><td>It will involve more overhead due to copying data, especially for large structures.</td></tr><tr><td>Complexity </td><td>It will have side effects if not managed carefully</td><td>It is easy to manage as it doesn&#8217;t have side effects on the actual parameters.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>What is the List of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Languages</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Ans</strong>. The Object-Oriented Programming Languages include</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Java</li>



<li>C++</li>



<li>Python</li>



<li>JavaScript</li>



<li>PHP</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>5</strong>. <strong>What is  Structured Programming</strong>?<br><strong>Ans</strong>. Structured Programming is a programming approach where the control flow is organized and clear. It uses constructs like if/else, for/while loops, and functions. This method ensures that the program is easy to follow and understand, and itâ€™s a foundation for other programming styles, including Object-Oriented Programming.</p>



<p><strong>6.  What are Inline Functions in C++ and C?</strong><br><strong>Ans</strong>. Inline functions in C++ and C use the keyword &#8220;inline&#8221;. These functions are expanded to reduce function call overhead, similar to how the &#8220;register&#8221; keyword optimizes variable storage. Inline functions also help avoid linking issues when functions it is defined in multiple files.</p>



<p><strong>Example of an Inline Function in C:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>   inline int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }</code></pre>



<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>What are </strong><strong>C++ Destructors?</strong><br><strong>Ans</strong>. Destructors in C++ are special member functions called when an object is destroyed. They clean up resources like memory allocated during the object&#8217;s lifetime.</p>



<p>Syntax :</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>   ~ClassName();</code></pre>



<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>What is the Java Finalize Method</strong>?<br><strong>Ans</strong>. The <code>finalize</code> method in Java is used to perform cleanup before an object is destroyed. It&#8217;s called the garbage collector.</p>



<p><strong>Example of using the <code>finalize</code> Method:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>   public class FinalizeExample {
       protected void finalize() {
           System.out.println("Finalize method called");
       }

       public static void main(String&#91;] args) {
           FinalizeExample obj = new FinalizeExample();
           obj = null;
           System.gc();
       }
   }</code></pre>



<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>What are C++ or C Tokens</strong>?<br><strong>Ans</strong>. In C++ or C, tokens are the smallest units of the program that the compiler understands. Types of tokens include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keywords (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>class</code>)</li>



<li>Strings (e.g., <code>"Hello"</code>)</li>



<li>Identifiers (e.g., <code>x</code>, <code>myVar</code>)</li>



<li>Special symbols (e.g., <code>\n</code>, <code>\t</code>)</li>



<li>Constants (e.g., <code>5</code>, <code>3.14</code>)</li>



<li>Operators (e.g., <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>)</li>
</ul>
