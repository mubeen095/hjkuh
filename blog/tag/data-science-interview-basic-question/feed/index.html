<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10 Data Science Interview Basic Question And Answer</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What is Data Science?<br>Ans.<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-eligibility-criteria/" data-type="post" data-id="5620"> Data Science</a> is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to analyze and interpret complex data sets, often involving big data. </li>
</ol>



<p>2. Differentiate between Data Analytics and Data Science</p>



<p>Ans.<a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/data-science-vs-data-analytics/" data-type="post" data-id="4405">Data Analytics</a>: Focuses on processing and performing statistical analysis of existing datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can guide decision-making. </p>



<p>Data Science: Encompasses a broader scope, including not only data analysis but also machine learning, predictive modeling, and the development of algorithms.</p>



<p>   3. How is Python useful?</p>



<p>Ans. <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/mern-stack-with-python/" data-type="post" data-id="4309">Python</a> is a widely used programming language in the field of Data Science. Its popularity is attributed to its readability, versatility, and vast ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. </p>



<p>4. How R is Useful in the Data Science Domain?</p>



<p>Ans.R is another programming language commonly used in Data Science. It is particularly strong in statistical computing and data visualization. R provides a wide range of packages for statistical analysis and has a dedicated community of statisticians and data scientists. While Python is versatile, R is often favored for its statistical capabilities.</p>



<p>5. What is  Supervised Learning?</p>



<p>Ans. Supervised learning is a type of <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions-and-answers/" data-type="post" data-id="3717">machine learning </a>where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means the input data is paired with the corresponding correct output. The algorithm learns from this labeled data to make predictions or decisions when given new, unseen data.</p>



<p>6.What is Unsupervised Learning?</p>



<p>Ans.Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to identify patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without explicit guidance on the output. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.</p>



<p>7. What do you understand about near Regression?</p>



<p>Ans.Linear Regression is a statistical method used in machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values.</p>



<p>8. What do you understand by logistic regression?</p>



<p>Ans.Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. Unlike linear regression, it models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category. The output is transformed using the logistic function, providing a probability score between 0 and 1.</p>



<p>9. What is a confusion matrix?</p>



<p>Ans.A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It compares the actual values of a dataset with the predicted values and categorizes them into four groups: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).</p>



<p>10. What do you understand about the true-positive rate and false-positive rate?</p>



<p>Ans.True-Positive Rate (Sensitivity or Recall): It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positives. It is a measure of how well a model can identify positive instances.</p>



<p>False-Positive Rate: It is the ratio of incorrectly predicted positive observations to the total actual negatives. It indicates the proportion of negative instances that were incorrectly classified as positive.</p>
