<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mern Stack Interview Questions And Answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How does React work?</strong><br>Ans.React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM. React components represent different parts of a user interface and can be reused throughout an application. React maintains a virtual DOM in memory, compares it with the actual DOM, and updates only the parts that have changed, which makes the process more efficient.</li>



<li><strong>What are React Hooks?</strong><br>Ans.React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, which were previously exclusive to class components. Commonly used hooks include <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, and <code>useContext</code>.</li>



<li><strong>What are props in React?</strong><br>Ans. Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are read-only and help in communication between components. Props are passed down the component tree, allowing for the creation of dynamic and reusable components.</li>



<li><strong>What are the advantages of ReactJS?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> Improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.</li>



<li><strong>Component-Based:</strong> Encourages modular and reusable code through components.</li>



<li><strong>Declarative Syntax:</strong> Simplifies the process of understanding and writing UI code.</li>



<li><strong>One-Way Data Binding:</strong> Makes it easier to manage and track the flow of data.</li>



<li><strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Large and active community, extensive libraries, and support.</li>
</ul>



<p>5.<strong>How is React different from Angular JS?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language:</strong> React uses JavaScript (or JSX), while Angular uses TypeScript.</li>



<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> React is just a library for the view layer, while Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework.</li>



<li><strong>Data Binding:</strong> React uses one-way data binding, and Angular uses two-way data binding.</li>



<li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> React uses a virtual DOM, while Angular directly manipulates the real DOM.</li>



<li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> React is generally considered easier to learn than Angular.</li>
</ul>



<p>6.<strong>What is Replication in MongoDB?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.<br>Replication in MongoDB is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It involves maintaining multiple copies of the data on different servers, known as replica sets. In case one server goes down, another can take over, ensuring continuous availability.</p>



<p>7.<strong>What are Higher-Order Components in React?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.<br>Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced features. HOCs are a way to reuse component logic, share code between components, and abstract complex behavior into a separate component.</p>



<p>8.<strong>What are advantages of using React Hooks?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Simplifies State and Lifecycle Management:</strong> <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> make it easier to manage component state and lifecycle in functional components.</li>



<li><strong>Encourages Reusability:</strong> Hooks allow the reuse of stateful logic across multiple components.</li>



<li><strong>Reduces Boilerplate Code:</strong> Hooks often result in less code compared to equivalent class components.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced Readability:</strong> Hooks can make the code more readable and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>



<p>9.<strong>What are the limitations of React?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> While React itself is relatively simple, the ecosystem and associated tools may have a learning curve.</li>



<li><strong>Overhead:</strong> React applications may have a larger initial bundle size compared to some other frameworks.</li>



<li><strong>JSX:</strong> Some developers may find JSX syntax unusual or challenging initially.</li>



<li><strong>SEO:</strong> React applications may require additional effort for search engine optimization.</li>
</ul>



<p>10. <strong>What are the differences between a class component and a Functional component?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Class components use the ES6 class syntax, while functional components are just JavaScript functions.</li>



<li><strong>State and Lifecycle:</strong> Class components can have local state and lifecycle methods, whereas functional components can use hooks for state and lifecycle functionality.</li>



<li><strong>Readability:</strong> Functional components are often considered more concise and easier to read.</li>



<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Functional components with hooks may have better performance due to the absence of some overhead associated with class components.</li>
</ul>



<p>11. <strong>What are the key features of Node.js?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Asynchronous I/O:</strong> Non-blocking I/O operations for efficient handling of concurrent requests.</li>



<li><strong>Event-Driven:</strong> Uses an event-driven, asynchronous model.</li>



<li><strong>Single-Threaded:</strong> Utilizes a single-threaded event loop for handling multiple concurrent connections.</li>



<li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Runs on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>



<li><strong>NPM (Node Package Manager):</strong> A vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules.</li>
</ul>



<p>12.<strong>What do you mean by Asynchronous API?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.<br>An asynchronous API (Application Programming Interface) allows certain operations to be performed asynchronously. In the context of web development, this often involves making requests to servers or executing code without blocking the main thread. Asynchronous APIs use mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle asynchronous operations.</p>



<p>13.<strong>What is Callback Hell and What is the main cause of it?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.<br>Callback Hell, also known as &#8220;Pyramid of Doom,&#8221; refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. It occurs when handling asynchronous operations using callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, creating a deep and indented structure. The main cause is the nature of JavaScript&#8217;s callback-based approach for handling asynchronous tasks, which can lead to deeply nested and hard-to-follow code.</p>



<p>14.<strong>What is Reconciliation in ReactJS?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.<br>Reconciliation in React is the process of updating the DOM to match the virtual DOM when there are changes in a component&#8217;s state or props. React&#8217;s diffing algorithm (a part of the reconciliation process) efficiently determines the minimal number of changes needed to update the DOM. This helps in optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary updates to the actual DOM, making the UI updates more efficient.</p>
