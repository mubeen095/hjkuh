<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-future-of-chatgpt">The Future Of Chatgpt</h2>



<p>The future of ChatGPT, like many advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, is poised to be both exciting and transformative. As we stand in this new era, where human-computer interaction, the capabilities and potential applications of ChatGPT and similar AI models are expanding at an astonishing pace. This technology has the potential to revolutionize numerous industries, from customer service and healthcare to content creation and education. In this discussion, we will explore the emerging trends, challenges, and the boundless possibilities that lie ahead for ChatGPT and AI-driven conversational agents, as they continue to shape the way we interact with information and technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rise-of-transformers">Rise Of Transformers</h2>



<p>Transformer Technology has become the model of choice for NLP Problems it was first invented by Google and later, it was developed by other companies such as Open AI, and then they created Chat GPT. The Power of Transformer Technology and its capability to take large databases and generate various outputs.   Also, Chat GPT  has become one of the generalist AI Technologies and, is now used for various tasks by people. Hence, we know that it could later produce video and audio data to produce much more powerful and versatile generalist outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="transforming-the-transformers-creating-more-specialist-ai">Transforming the Transformers-Creating More Specialist AI</h2>



<p>Transformers need a large database to be more effective and this technology is only accessible in large companies such as Google and Microsoft. The technology further depends on the amount of data required for training. Several Problems arise when there is limited data and AI can&#8217;t train by itself. Thus, Generalist AI technology will develop and they won&#8217;t depend on the transformers, but instead on the other methods to train AI with limited data. Moreover, this can permit smaller companies and startups with limited access to produce more specialized AI Models that can function more effectively.</p>



<p>Indeed, we know that data that is available on the internet has images, videos, and audio. Thus, creating an AI Model that can effectively interpret the data . Thus, we can make a more powerful use case for AI. AI model can also train to produce an audio clip of a news anchor by navigating data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="of-counter-technology-and-ai-whispers">Of Counter Technology and AI  Whispers</h2>



<p>Due to the major technological shift, there are several concerns that Al can lead to losing jobs. There are also rumors that the introduction of AI can have a negative impact on the agricultural sector, however, this was proved to be false, since new jobs were created in this agricultural sector.  Thus, due to the rise of AI, new jobs will develop in various fields such as AI ethical professionals,  AI trainers, or AI Whisperers.</p>



<p>Further, We can understand that to attain Factual accuracy with AI is the biggest challenge. That is, if we type a wrong statement such as 2+2 =5, the AI  will give the reason to get the answer as 5. Hence, developing LLMs requires more effort to get the correct answer. The  AI will produce more factual data than just providing explanations. Therefore, it requires more real-time data. We also know that Real-time data is repeatedly being produced at every moment. Hence, it is more convenient to use specialized AI instead of Generalist AI.  Specialized AI will be trained on particular data which will offer both factual information and reasoning ability.</p>



<p>AI will now work upon the human biases which are presented as data and they are being trained on it. This can consist of biases like racism and will be carried upon by AI and these are trained on data that contains discriminatory language. In fact, if people bully each other on Twitter, then there is a possibility of AI creating content related to that incident. However, Changing data privacy laws and checking on AI Data consumption can be a great starting point to shape Al for the future. </p>
