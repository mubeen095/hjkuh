<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Manual Testing Interview Questions And Answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>What is Software Testing?</strong><br>Ans. Software Testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify any discrepancies between the expected and actual results. The goal is to ensure that the software meets specified requirements, is free of defects, and functions as intended.</li>



<li><strong>How does quality control differ from quality assurance?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Quality Control (QC):</strong> Focuses on identifying and fixing defects in the product. It is a reactive process that occurs after the product is developed.</li>



<li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> Involves activities that ensure the processes, methods, and standards used for developing the product are appropriate. QA is a proactive process that aims to prevent defects.</li>
</ul>



<p>3.<strong>Why is Software Testing Required?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Software Testing is crucial for various reasons:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identifying defects and issues early in the development process.</li>



<li>Ensuring the software meets user requirements.</li>



<li>Enhancing the reliability and quality of the software.</li>



<li>Reducing the risk of software failure in the production environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>4. <strong>What are the two main categories of software testing?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Manual Testing:</strong> Testers manually execute test cases without using any automation tools.</li>



<li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Testers use automation tools to execute test scripts and compare actual outcomes with expected outcomes.</li>
</ul>



<p>5.<strong>What is quality control? Is it similar to Quality Assurance?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Quality Control (QC):</strong> The process of ensuring that the product meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. It is a reactive process that involves testing and fixing defects.</li>



<li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> The process of ensuring that the processes, methods, and standards used for developing the product are appropriate. QA is a proactive process aimed at preventing defects.</li>
</ul>



<p>6. <strong>What different types of manual testing are there?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components or modules.</li>



<li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing the combination of multiple components.</li>



<li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Testing the entire system as a whole.</li>



<li><strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> Ensuring the software meets user requirements.</li>
</ul>



<p>7.<strong>Explain the difference between alpha testing and beta testing.</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Alpha Testing:</strong> Conducted by the internal development team to identify issues before releasing the software to external users.</li>



<li><strong>Beta Testing:</strong> Conducted by a selected group of external users who test the software in a real-world environment before its official release.</li>
</ul>



<p>8.<strong><strong>Why is it that the boundary value analysis provides good test cases?</strong></strong></p>



<p>Ans. </p>



<p>Boundary value analysis is an effective testing technique because it targets potential errors at the boundaries of the input domain. Instead of focusing on the center of the range, this method emphasizes values at the edges and boundaries.</p>



<p>In the context of testing an input box accepting numbers from &#8217;01 to 10&#8242;, boundary value analysis categorizes test cases into three classes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Test cases at input boundaries:</strong> Includes values exactly at the boundaries, such as 1 and 10.</li>



<li><strong>Values just below the extreme edges:</strong> Involves test data slightly below the minimum and maximum boundaries, like 0 and 9.</li>



<li><strong>Test data just above the extreme edges:</strong> Covers values just above the minimum and maximum boundaries, such as 2 and 11.</li>
</ol>



<p>In the given example, the boundary values to be tested are 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, and 11. This method ensures comprehensive testing by examining scenarios both within and just outside the specified boundaries, helping to uncover potential issues that might occur in real-world usage.</p>



<p>9.<strong>What is a testbed in manual testing?</strong></p>



<p>Ans. A testbed in manual testing refers to the environment or infrastructure set up for conducting testing activities. It includes hardware, software, network configurations, and other necessary components essential for testing the software application. The testbed provides the necessary resources and conditions to execute test cases and evaluate the behavior of the software under various scenarios.</p>



<p>10.<strong>Explain the procedure for manual testing</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<p><span style="font-size: inherit; background-color: var(--base-3); color: var(--contrast);">The procedure for manual testing typically involves the following steps:</span></p>



<p>a.<strong>Test Planning:</strong> Define the testing objectives, scope, and resources.</p>



<p>b.<strong>Test Case Design:</strong> Create test cases based on requirements and specifications.</p>



<p>c.<strong>Test Environment Setup:</strong> Set up the necessary hardware and software for testing.</p>



<p>d.<strong>Test Execution:</strong> Perform manual testing by executing test cases and recording results.</p>



<p>e.<strong>Defect Reporting:</strong> Document and report any defects or issues found during testing.</p>



<p>f.<strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Re-run test cases to ensure new changes haven&#8217;t introduced new defects.</p>



<p>g.<strong>Test Closure:</strong> Summarize test results, evaluate testing activities, and prepare test closure reports.</p>



<p>11.<strong>What is a test scenario?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.A test scenario is a detailed description of a specific test case. It outlines the conditions, actions, and expected results of a particular testing activity. Test scenarios help in defining the scope of testing and guide testers in executing tests to ensure the software meets specified requirements.</p>



<p>12. <strong>What is GUI testing?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the functionality and appearance of the graphical elements of a user interface. It includes testing buttons, menus, icons, windows, and other visual components to ensure they respond correctly to user interactions and adhere to design specifications.</p>



<p>13.<strong>When should testing end?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The decision to end testing depends on various factors, including:</li>



<li>Achievement of testing objectives.</li>



<li>Sufficient test coverage.</li>



<li>Meeting exit criteria.</li>



<li>Time and budget constraints.</li>



<li>Stability and reliability of the software.</li>



<li>Approval from stakeholders.</li>
</ul>



<p>14.<strong>What are the different types of Software testing?</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<p>There are various types of software testing, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unit Testing</li>



<li>Integration Testing</li>



<li>System Testing</li>



<li>Acceptance Testing</li>



<li>Regression Testing</li>



<li>Performance Testing</li>



<li>Security Testing</li>



<li>Usability Testing</li>



<li>Compatibility Testing</li>



<li>Exploratory Testing</li>
</ul>



<p>15.<strong>What is Acceptance testing?</strong></p>



<p>Ans. Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing where the software is evaluated to ensure it meets the specified business requirements. It is conducted to gain confidence that the system is ready for deployment. Types of acceptance testing include User Acceptance Testing (UAT), Business Acceptance Testing (BAT), and Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT). The primary goal is to validate that the software satisfies user expectations and is ready for production use.</p>
