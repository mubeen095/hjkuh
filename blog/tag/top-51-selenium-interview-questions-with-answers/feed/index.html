<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Selenium Interview Questions With Answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What is Selenium:<br>Ans. Selenium is an open-source framework for automating web applications. It provides a way for developers and testers to write scripts in various programming languages like Java, Python, C#, etc., to automate interactions with web browsers. Selenium supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.</li>



<li>What are the Selenium Suite Components:<br>Ans.The Selenium suite consists of several components:</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)<strong>:</strong> A Firefox and Chrome browser plugin for creating simple Selenium scripts through a record-and-playback mechanism.</li>



<li>Selenium WebDriver: A powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program. It enables dynamic and complex interactions with web elements.</li>



<li>Selenium Grid<strong>:</strong> Allows for parallel test execution on multiple machines, making it possible to run tests on different environments and browsers simultaneously.</li>
</ul>



<p>3. Mention the  Advantages of Selenium as an Automation Tool</p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Open Source: Selenium is freely available and can be modified and extended.</li>



<li>Cross-browser Compatibility: Selenium supports multiple browsers, ensuring the application&#8217;s compatibility across different platforms.</li>



<li>Multiple Programming Language Support: Selenium supports various programming languages, such as Java, Python, C#, etc.</li>



<li>Large Community: Selenium has a vast user community, providing ample resources, tutorials, and support.</li>



<li>Platform Independence: Selenium is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
</ul>



<p>4.What is Test Automation or Automation Testing</p>



<p>Ans.<br>Test automation, or automation testing, is the process of using specialized tools and programming to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. It is employed to automate repetitive but necessary testing tasks, helping in the execution of test cases quickly, efficiently, and repeatedly.</p>



<p>5.What are the Advantages of Automation Testing</p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Faster Execution: Automated tests can be run significantly faster than manual tests.</li>



<li>Reusability: Test scripts can be reused across different phases of development and in various projects.</li>



<li>Accuracy: Automation reduces the chance of human errors that can occur during manual testing.</li>



<li>Increased Test Coverage: Automation allows for the execution of a large number of test cases during every test run.</li>



<li>Regression Testing: Automated testing is effective for executing repeated tests, such as regression tests, ensuring that new code changes don&#8217;t adversely affect existing functionality.</li>
</ul>



<p>6. What is Selenese? How is it classified?</p>



<p>Ans.<br>Selenese is the language used by Selenium to write test scripts. It consists of various commands, each representing an operation on the browser, such as opening a URL, clicking a button, verifying text, etc. Selenese commands can be categorized into three types: Actions, Accessors, and Assertions.</p>



<p>7. What are the Limitations of Selenium Testing:</p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited Support for Desktop Applications: Selenium primarily focuses on web applications and has limited support for testing desktop applications.</li>



<li>No Built-in Reporting: Selenium lacks built-in reporting capabilities, requiring integration with third-party tools for detailed test reports.</li>



<li>Steeper Learning Curve: Selenium requires programming knowledge, and users need to be familiar with scripting languages.</li>



<li>Limited Mobile Testing: Selenium can automate mobile browsers but is not designed for native mobile applications.</li>
</ul>



<p>8.What is the Difference Between Selenium 2.0 and Selenium 3.0</p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>WebDriver Integration<strong>:</strong> Selenium 2.0 introduced WebDriver, a more powerful and flexible API for browser automation. Selenium 3.0 continues to support WebDriver.</li>



<li>Webdriver W3C Standardization<strong>:</strong> Selenium 3.0 includes the adoption of the WebDriver W3C standard, aiming for better consistency and compatibility across browsers.</li>



<li>GeckoDriver for Firefox: Selenium 3.0 requires the use of GeckoDriver for Firefox, as the legacy FirefoxDriver is no longer supported.</li>



<li>Grid Enhancement<strong>:</strong> Selenium Grid in version 3.0 has some enhancements, including improved stability and better support for different browser versions.</li>
</ul>



<p>9. What are the testing types supported by Selenium?&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ans.Regression Testing:</h4>



<p>Regression Testing is the process of re-running a set of test cases to ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected the existing functionality of the application. Your steps for Regression Testing are on point:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Re-testing: All tests in the existing test suite are executed to ensure that the modified code functions correctly.</li>



<li>Regression Test Selection: Tests are classified based on their type (feature tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests), and a subset of these tests is selected for execution to cover critical areas impacted by the changes.</li>



<li>Prioritization of Test Cases<strong>:</strong> The selected test cases are prioritized based on their business impact and critical functionalities. This helps in focusing on high-priority tests first.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Functional Testing:</h4>



<p>Functional Testing is the process of verifying that the software application behaves according to the specified requirements. This type of testing ensures that every function of the application works as intended. The steps involved in Functional Testing include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify Test Input: Define the input data for the specific function being tested. This could involve various types of input, including valid and invalid data.</li>



<li>Compute Test Outcome<strong>:</strong> Execute the function with the identified test input and compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome. If there are any discrepancies, it indicates a potential defect.</li>



<li>Execute test</li>



<li>Compare the test outcome along  with the actual outcome&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Functional Testing aims to validate the functional aspects of the software, such as user interfaces, APIs, databases, security, client/server applications, and functionality.</p>



<p>10. What are the different types of annotations which are used in Selenium?</p>



<p>Ans. </p>



<p>Different types of annotations that are used in Selenium include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>@Test &#8211; This annotation is meant to refer  a method as a test method</li>



<li>@BeforeMethod &#8211; This annotation is meant to illustrate  a method before each test method</li>



<li>@AfterMethod &#8211; This annotation is meant to refer a method after each test method</li>



<li>@BeforeClass &#8211; This annotation is used to execute a method before the first test method</li>
</ul>
