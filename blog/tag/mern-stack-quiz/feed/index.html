<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is MERN used for?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The MERN stack is a cool set of tools that helps make apps fast. People everywhere use it because it&#8217;s great. The special thing about MERN is that it lets developers use only JavaScript to build apps. That&#8217;s because all four parts of the MERN stack are based on JavaScript. So, with MERN, you can use just one language to make really cool apps super quickly!</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. Is MERN stack a skill?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In the MERN stack, both the front and back parts of making a website use React and Node.js. So, MERN developers need to be really good at some specific things like ES6+ (that&#8217;s a fancy version of JavaScript), knowing how to work with things happening at the same time (asynchronous programming), and understanding functional programming ideas. This helps them make applications that work really well.</p>
