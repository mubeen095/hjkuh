<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="difference-between-the-mern-stack-and-the-mean-stack"> Difference Between the MERN Stack and the MEAN Stack</h2>



<p>Web development is a process that involves the development of the website. A website basically consists of three ends. Those are client-side, server-side, and the database. Whereas, these three ends are various sides of an application that will combine together in order to deliver an application. These ends are implemented separately with the different technology. MEAN and MERN are the technologies that work for the development of all ends of web applications. Therefore, this kind of development is referred as the full -stack development.These stacks will consists of tools and technologies that is required to create a web application.</p>



<p><strong>What is MEAN Stack</strong></p>



<p>The full form of Mean Stack is Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular and Node JS. It refers to set of technologies that will be used to develop each end of the web application.More details about these technologies is given below:</p>



<p>a.<strong>MongoDB:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MongoDB is a NoSQL database using BSON for data storage, designed for scalability and flexibility in handling unstructured data.</li>
</ul>



<p>b.<strong>Express.js:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, simplifying server-side development with features for routing and handling HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>



<p>c.<strong>Angular:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Angular is a client-side framework by Google for building single-page applications, using TypeScript for scalability and offering features like two-way data binding.</li>
</ul>



<p>d.<strong>Node.js:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime enabling server-side execution, commonly used for scalable network applications and as the server runtime in the MEAN stack.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-will-mean-stack-work">How will MEAN Stack work?</h2>



<p>Angular manages the user interface (UI) implementation. When the UI needs data, it sends a request to the server. The server, powered by Node.js and Express.js, retrieves the necessary information from MongoDB. Upon successfully finding the data, the server sends the response back to the client side.</p>



<p>Benefits Of MEAN Stack</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The whole technology needs JavaScript for implementing the programs.</li>



<li>It has the capability of improving the re-usability of code</li>



<li>It is very easy to learn</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-mern-stack">What is MERN Stack</h2>



<p>MERN stack includes:</p>



<p>a.<strong>MongoDB:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A flexible NoSQL database storing data in BSON format, suitable for dynamic web apps.</li>
</ul>



<p>b.<strong>Express.js:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A JavaScript framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.</li>
</ul>



<p>c.<strong>React.js:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces on the client side.</li>
</ul>



<p>d.<strong>Node.js:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, MERN stack enables end-to-end development of web applications with JavaScript.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-will-mern-stack-work">How will MERN Stack work?</h2>



<p>Mern Stack works similar to the Mean Stack. This can even use React JS for the frontend. ReactJS is responsible for bringing requests to the server and having various data exchanges.</p>



<p><strong>Benefits of MERN Stack</strong></p>



<p>React Router facilitates client-side navigation, allowing users to create single-page applications. All technologies in this stack exclusively use JavaScript, making it easy to learn and explore. Additionally, React Router supports the implementation of real-time applications, enhancing the stack&#8217;s versatility for dynamic web development.</p>

<div class="rank-math-list ">
<div id="faq-question-1701236904967" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. Which is better MERN stack or MEAN stack?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. MEAN stack excels in large-scale applications, prioritizing robustness. MERN stack leads in the rapid development of smaller applications, emphasizing speed and simplicity. The choice depends on project-specific needs and scale.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. What is difference between MERN stack and full stack?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Full Stack is for any application, MEAN/MERN are for JavaScript apps with scalability. They include libraries like jQuery, LESS, etc., adding functionality.</p>
