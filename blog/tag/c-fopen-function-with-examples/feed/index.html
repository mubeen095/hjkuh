<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="c-fopen-function-with-examples">C fopen() Function With Examples</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>fopen() method</strong>&nbsp;in C is a library function that functions to open a file to perform various operations which include reading, writing, etc. along with various modes. If the file exists, then the fopen() function will open the particular file a new file is created.</p>



<p>Syntax</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>FILE *fopen(const char *file_name, const char *mode_of_operation);
</code></pre>



<p>Parameters</p>



<p>The method takes two parameters, both of character pointer type:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>file_name:</strong> This parameter, of C string type, holds the name of the file to be opened.</li>



<li><strong>mode_of_operation:</strong> Also a C string type, this parameter indicates the mode of file access, specifying whether the file will be opened for reading, writing, or both.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="table-lists-valid-mode-of-operation-values-in-c-with-their-meaning"><strong>&nbsp;Table lists valid mode_of_operation values in C with their meaning</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Opening Modes</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>r</strong></td><td>This function will Search the file. It will Open the file for reading only.&nbsp;If the file is opened successfully fopen() loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the first character in it. If the file cannot be opened fopen() returns NULL.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>w</strong></td><td>This function will Search the file. If the file exists already, its contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn’t exist, a new file is made. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.&nbsp;It creates a new file for writing only(no reading).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>a</strong></td><td>This function will Searches the file.&nbsp;Opens the file for both reading and writing.&nbsp;If opened successfully, fopen() loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the first character in it. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>r+</strong></td><td>This function will search the file.&nbsp;Opens the file for both reading and writing.&nbsp;If it is opened successfully, open f () loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the first character in it.

If the file is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the last character in it. If the file doesn’t exist, a new file will be formed.

A&nbsp;new file will be made &nbsp;if no file exists with the name.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>rb+</strong></td><td>It functions to Open the&nbsp;binary file in append mode.&nbsp;The file pointer is set&nbsp;after the last character in the file. A&nbsp;new file will be made if no file exists with the name.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>wb+</strong></td><td>Open the&nbsp;binary file in read and write mode.&nbsp;Contents are overwritten if the file exists. It will be created if the file does not exist.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ab+</strong></td><td>Open the&nbsp;binary file in read and append mode.&nbsp;A file will be created if the file does not exist.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="return-value">Return Value</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The function is used to return a pointer to FILE if the execution succeeds else NULL is returned.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-of-fopen">Example of fopen()</h3>



<p>On running the following command, a new file will be created by the name “<strong>demo_file.txt</strong>” with the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>


// C program to illustrate fopen()
 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
int main()
{
 
    // pointer demo to FILE
    FILE* demo;
 
    // Creates a file "demo_file"
    // with file access as write-plus mode
    demo = fopen("demo_file.txt", "w+");
 
    // adds content to the file
    fprintf(demo, "%s %s %s", "Welcome", "to",
            "Skillvertex");
 
    // closes the file pointed by demo
    fclose(demo);
 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>



<p>According to the command , a new file will be produced by the name “<strong>demo_file.txt</strong>” with the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Welcome to Skillvertex
</code></pre>



<p><strong>To view the file, Run the following code, which will open the file and display its content.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to illustrate fopen()

    // Creates a file "demo_file"
    // with file access as read mode
    demo = fopen("demo_file.txt", "r");
 
    // loop to extract every characters
    while (1) {
        // reading file
        display = fgetc(demo);
 
        // end of file indicator
        if (feof(demo))

        // displaying every characters
        printf("%c", display);
    }

<div id="faq-question-1700043553540" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What does fopen () function do in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The <code>fopen()</code> function is used to open a file identified by its filename and establish a connection to it through a stream. The mode variable, represented as a character string, defines the type of access that is requested for the file, such as reading, writing, or both.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1700043561203" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. What is the return type of the fopen () function in C *?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The <code>fopen()</code> function returns a pointer to a FILE structure type, enabling access to the opened file. This pointer is crucial for performing operations on the file, such as reading or writing. It&#8217;s important to note that when working with stream files of type record, you may need to cast the FILE pointer to an RFILE pointer to use record I/O functions effectively.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1700043572102" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What is the difference between fopen and open in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The <code>fopen()</code> function in C returns a <code>FILE*</code> (file pointer), which is used with functions like <code>fprintf()</code>, <code>fscanf()</code>, etc. On the other hand, the <code>open()</code> system call returns a file descriptor (an integer), which is often used with low-level functions like <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code></p>
