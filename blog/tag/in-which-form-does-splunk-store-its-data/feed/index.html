<p>Splunk stores its data in a proprietary format called &#8220;Splunk index.&#8221; The index is a structured and optimized format that allows Splunk to perform efficient searching, indexing, and retrieval of data. Splunk indexes are designed to provide fast and flexible search capabilities across large volumes of machine-generated data.</p>



<p>Splunk takes the data ingested from various sources, such as log files, events, and other forms of machine data, and it indexes this data to make it searchable and analyzable. The data is stored in a binary format optimized for both storage efficiency and search performance.</p>



<p>Splunk also provides tools and mechanisms to manage and maintain these indexes, such as index rotation, retention policies, and more. Users can configure these settings to control how long data is retained in the indexes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Splunk&#8217;s proprietary data storage format is one of the reasons for its powerful search and analysis capabilities, but it also means that data ingested into Splunk is not typically accessible in its raw form outside of Splunk&#8217;s interface and query language.</p>
