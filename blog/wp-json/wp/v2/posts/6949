It will make sure that the text will consists of letters, symbols, emoji and other control characters and  will appear same in the different devices , platforms and  digital documents . Unicode plays an  vital role in the internet and computing industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, working with Unicode in Python will be difficult and can lead to several errors. Read this tutorial to learn the fundamentals of using Unicode in Python. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-unicode-system\">What is Unicode System?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/data-science-vs-software-engineering\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4498\">Software<\/a> applications must need to show the display message output in several languages like English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, or Hindi. Python&#8217;s string type will use the  Unicode Standard to denote the characters. This Python Program will allow work with different possible characters. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, a character is referred to as the smallest component of text. Some of the different characters are &#8216;A&#8217;, &#8216;B&#8217;, and &#8216;C&#8217;. Similarly, E and I are also included. A Unicode string is referred to as a sequence of code points and those are numbers from 0 through  0x10FFFF (1,114,111 decimal). Therefore, These sequences of code should be represented in memory as a set of code units and further, these code units will be mapped into 8-bit bytes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-character-encoding\">What is Character Encoding?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a sequence of code points,  which will be denoted in the form of memory as a set of code units, and then they are mapped into the 8-bit bytes. Character Encoding refers as the rules that are used to translate a Unicode String into a sequence of bytes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three types of Encoding are present and those are  UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. UTF is referred to as the Unicode Transformation Format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"python-unicode-support\">Python Unicode Support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Built-in support for Unicode is available from Python 3.0 onwards. The str type will consist of Unicode Characters and thus any string will be made using the single, double, or triple-quoted string syntax and further it is stored as Unicode. The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Henceforth, the string has a representation of the Unicode character (3\/4) or its Unicode value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var = \"3\/4\"\nprint (var)\nvar = \"\\u00BE\"\nprint (var)<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>3\/4\n\u00be<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-1\">Example 1 <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The example given below, a string 10 will be stored with the Unicode values of 1 and 0 and has values such as  \\u0031 and u0030 .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var = \"\\u0031\\u0030\"\nprint (var)<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>10<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the string will show the text in the human-readable format.  Bytes will store the binary characters as the binary data. Encoding will turn data into a series of bytes from the character string. Decoding is referred to as a process that will translate the bytes back to human-readable characters and symbols. In other words, encode is the string method and the decode is the Python byte object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-2\">Example 2 <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the provided example, the string <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/python-variables\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6932\">variable<\/a> has ASCII characters. ASCII is the sub-division of the Unicode character set. The encode method () will convert into the bytes object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>string = \"Hello\"\ntobytes = string.encode('utf-8')\nprint (tobytes)\nstring = tobytes.decode('utf-8')\nprint (string)<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The decode () method will turn the byte object back into the str object. The encoding method is mostly used in the utf-8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>b'Hello'\nHello<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-3\">Example 3<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This example has the Rupee symbol &nbsp;(\u20b9)&nbsp; that is stored in the variable with the help of Unicode value. Hence, we can turn the string to bytes and back to str.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>string = \"\\u20B9\"\nprint (string)\ntobytes = string.encode('utf-8')\nprint (tobytes)\nstring = tobytes.decode('utf-8')\nprint (string)<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The output that will be displayed after running the code is given below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\u20b9\nb'\\xe2\\x82\\xb9'\n\u20b9<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, this article will allow the beginner to improve their skills and knowledge regarding the Unicode system of Python.  Character Encoding and several examples are provided in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"python-unicode-system-fa-qs\">Python-Unicode System-FAQs<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1707288471883\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1.
