SKUs are used to define the characteristics and capabilities of different Azure resources and services, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and more. Each SKU typically comes with its own set of features, performance levels, and pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s consider Azure Virtual Machines. When you create a virtual machine, you choose a specific SKU that determines the virtual machine&#8217;s size, performance, memory, CPU, and other attributes. Different SKUs have different specifications and are suited for various workloads, from small applications to heavy computing tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Azure, SKUs help you customize the resources you provision to match your needs accurately. They allow you to balance performance, capacity, and cost based on your requirements. SKUs can also include options for different levels of support, security features, and additional services that come bundled with the resource.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, in the context of Microsoft Azure, a SKU defines the specific characteristics and configuration of a resource or service, helping users choose the right option that fits their requirements and budget.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What Is Sku In Azure?
