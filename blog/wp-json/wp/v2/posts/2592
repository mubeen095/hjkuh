It was originally known as &#8220;Oak&#8221; but was later renamed to &#8220;Java&#8221; in reference to the coffee that developers at Sun Microsystems enjoyed. The name &#8220;Java&#8221; was chosen as a brand, and it has nothing to do with the programming language&#8217;s characteristics.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>JavaScript<\/strong>: JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation around the same time. It was originally named &#8220;LiveScript.&#8221; However, to capitalize on the popularity of the emerging Java language, Netscape decided to rename it &#8220;JavaScript&#8221; to attract attention and suggest some connection between the two languages, even though they are fundamentally different.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>    2. <strong>Marketing Strategy<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The decision to rename &#8220;LiveScript&#8221; as &#8220;JavaScript&#8221; was partly a marketing strategy. Java was gaining a lot of attention and hype in the tech industry, and Netscape hoped that associating its scripting language with Java would help it gain more popularity and recognition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>    3. <strong>Technical Differences<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Java is a statically typed, object-oriented, and compiled programming language primarily used for building large-scale applications, including desktop applications, web applications (Java EE), and mobile apps (Android).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed, prototype-based scripting language primarily used for enhancing the interactivity of web pages. It is embedded within web browsers and is responsible for client-side scripting in web development.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, while JavaScript and Java have similar names, they are distinct languages with different purposes, features, and use cases. The name similarity is largely a historical artifact, and the two languages share no direct technical relationship beyond their superficial naming similarity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JavaScript and Java have similar names, but they are entirely different programming languages with distinct histories and purposes.
