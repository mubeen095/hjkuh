They can represent tasks, user stories, bugs, or other types of work. Each work item has fields to capture details like title, description, priority, and state.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Backlogs<\/strong>: The backlog is a prioritized list of work items, typically organized in a hierarchy. It helps you plan and prioritize work for your team. There are two types of backlogs: Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog (for Scrum).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sprints<\/strong>: Sprints are time-boxed iterations in Scrum methodology. You can plan work for a specific time frame, typically 2-4 weeks, and track progress during that sprint. Azure Boards provides tools for sprint planning and management.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kanban Boards<\/strong>: Kanban boards are visual boards that help you manage work items by moving them through different states (e.g., to-do, in-progress, done) as they progress. Azure Boards includes a Kanban board for tracking work in this way.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Custom Work Item Types<\/strong>: You can create custom work item types to match the specific needs of your project or organization. This allows you to define fields and workflows that make sense for your work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Queries<\/strong>: Queries allow you to search and filter work items based on various criteria. You can create simple or complex queries to find the work items you need.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dashboards<\/strong>: You can create dashboards to display important information and metrics for your project. Dashboards can include widgets like burndown charts, velocity charts, and other reports.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Boards and Charts<\/strong>: Azure Boards provides various visualization tools like task boards and cumulative flow diagrams to track the progress of work items and identify bottlenecks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Azure DevOps API<\/strong>: If you need to extend or integrate Azure Boards with other tools and services, you can use the Azure DevOps REST API.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integration with Azure Repos<\/strong>: Azure Boards seamlessly integrates with Azure Repos, the version control system in Azure DevOps, allowing you to associate work items with code changes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integration with Azure Pipelines<\/strong>: You can also link work items to build and release pipelines in Azure Pipelines, facilitating a connection between development and deployment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Notifications and Alerts<\/strong>: You can set up notifications and alerts to keep team members informed about changes to work items or other activities in Azure Boards.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These tools and features in Azure Boards provide a comprehensive platform for managing and tracking work items, whether you are following Scrum, Kanban, or other project management methodologies.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ans.
