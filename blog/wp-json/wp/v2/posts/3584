Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance network applications. Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time, data-intensive, and event-driven applications.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why use Node.js:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Single Programming Language:<\/strong> Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both server-side and client-side scripting, providing a consistent language across the entire application stack.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Non-blocking I\/O:<\/strong> Node.js is designed to be non-blocking, making it efficient for handling concurrent operations and providing high performance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Event-driven Architecture:<\/strong> Node.js uses an event-driven, asynchronous model, making it suitable for building scalable applications that can handle a large number of simultaneous connections.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Large Ecosystem (NPM):<\/strong> Node.js has a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules available through the Node Package Manager (NPM), facilitating rapid development.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community Support:<\/strong> It has a large and active community, leading to continuous improvement, updates, and the availability of resources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong>How Node.js works:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I\/O model.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It employs the V8 JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript code.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The event loop and callbacks handle asynchronous operations, allowing Node.js to efficiently manage multiple connections simultaneously.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<strong>Why is Node.js Single-threaded:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Node.js is single-threaded to provide simplicity and avoid the complexities of managing multiple threads and synchronization issues.However, it uses an event-driven, non-blocking model to handle concurrent operations efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<strong>Handling Concurrency in Node.js:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. While Node.js is single-threaded, it can handle concurrency through its event-driven, asynchronous architecture.I\/O operations, such as file system operations or network requests, are non-blocking, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for I\/O to complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>Callback in Node.js:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function in Node.js.It is commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading files or making network requests.When the asynchronous operation is completed, the callback function is invoked to handle the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<strong>Advantages of Promises over Callbacks:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Chaining:<\/strong> Promises allow for cleaner and more readable code through method chaining.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Error Handling:<\/strong> Promises provide a more structured way of handling errors, making it easier to catch and handle exceptions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>.<strong>Avoiding Callback Hell:<\/strong> Promises help mitigate the issue of nested callbacks, also known as &#8220;Callback Hell&#8221; or &#8220;Pyramid of Doom,&#8221; improving code maintainability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<strong>I\/O (Input\/Output):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.In the context of Node.js, I\/O refers to operations involving reading from or writing to external resources, such as files, databases, or network connections.Node.js is particularly efficient at handling I\/O operations asynchronously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.<strong>Most Frequent Use of Node.js:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Node.js is commonly used to build scalable network applications, such as web servers and real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming platforms, and collaborative tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.<strong>Frontend vs. Backend Development:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <strong>Frontend Development:<\/strong> Involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website or application. It deals with the presentation layer, including design, layout, and client-side scripting (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Backend Development:<\/strong> Involves building the server-side of a web application. It deals with server-side logic, databases, and handling requests from the client side. Technologies like Node.js are often used for backend development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11.<strong>NPM (Node Package Manager):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to discover, install, and manage packages and dependencies for their Node.js projects.It provides a vast repository of open-source libraries and tools, making it easy for developers to integrate pre-built functionality into their applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a01.What is Node.js?
