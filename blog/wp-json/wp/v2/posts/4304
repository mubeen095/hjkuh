Let&#8217;s break down each component:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>MongoDB:<\/strong> This is a NoSQL database that excels in flexibility and scalability, allowing developers to store and manage data in a document-oriented format.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Express.js:<\/strong> Serving as a backend web framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies the process of building robust server-side applications. It facilitates routing, middleware management, and other essential server-related tasks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>React:<\/strong> Developed by Facebook, React is a JavaScript library that focuses on building efficient and interactive user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the development of complex frontends more manageable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Node.js:<\/strong> This is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, these components form the MERN stack, offering a comprehensive solution for full-stack development. MongoDB handles data storage, Express.js manages server-side logic, React constructs dynamic and interactive user interfaces, and Node.js provides the runtime environment for server-side execution. This integrated stack provides developers with the tools needed to create modern, responsive, and scalable web applications across both frontend and backend components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faq-mern-stack-introduction\">FAQ- Mern Stack Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702383454127\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1. What is MERN stack?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. MERN stack is\u00a0a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. It is used by developers worldwide. The main aim of using the MERN stack is to build apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-base<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702383459924\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2.
