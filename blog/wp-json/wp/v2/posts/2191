This method is the entry point of the program, and it is executed when the program is run. The exact name and syntax for this method may vary depending on the programming language you are using, but it serves a similar purpose in most languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In C and C++, the entry point is defined as <code>int main()<\/code>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Java, the entry point is defined as <code>public static void main(String[] args)<\/code>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Python, the entry point is defined when you directly execute a Python script, and code at the top level is executed sequentially.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In JavaScript, the entry point can be defined using <code>function<\/code> statements or by running code in the global context.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry point is typically the starting point of your program and is executed only once when the program is run. It&#8217;s where the execution of your program begins, and from there, you can call other functions or methods to perform various tasks. Defining this method more than once in a program would lead to ambiguity, and the program might not compile or run correctly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A) main method B) finalize method C) static method D) private method Which Method Can Be Defined Only Once In A Program Option A) Main Method is the Correct Answer In most programming languages, the &#8220;main&#8221; method or function can typically be defined only once in a program.
