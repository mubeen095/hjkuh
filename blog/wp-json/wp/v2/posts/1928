It is used to define data structures, including tables, columns, and relationships, through its data definition language (DDL). SQL specifies the syntax and semantics of its data definition language (DDL), which is used for defining and managing the structure of databases. SQL also specifies the syntax and semantics of its data manipulation language (DML), which is used for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, SQL serves all of these purposes, as indicated in options A, B, and C.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A.
