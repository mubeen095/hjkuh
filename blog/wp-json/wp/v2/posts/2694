Option D) As much as you want is the Correct Answer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of classes that can be defined in a single program depends on the programming language you are using and the specific constraints of the environment or platform you are working with. In most programming languages, there is no strict limit on the number of classes you can define in a single program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there may be practical limitations based on the available memory and system resources. If you define an extremely large number of classes, it could lead to increased memory usage and slower compilation times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s generally a good practice to organize your code in a way that makes it manageable and maintainable. Breaking your code into a large number of classes can sometimes indicate a need for better abstraction and design. In object-oriented programming, classes should represent meaningful objects or concepts in your application, and having too many classes can make your codebase more complex than necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while there is no fixed limit on the number of classes in a program, it&#8217;s advisable to create classes for specific and logical purposes, following good software design principles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A) Only 1 B) Only 100 C) Only 999 D) As many as you want How Many Classes Can Be Defined In A Single Program?
