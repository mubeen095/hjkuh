They are used to store memory addresses of variables, functions, and other pointers, enabling powerful features like low-level memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and more. Pointers are a crucial tool for manipulating and managing memory and data structures in C.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-pointer-in-c\">What is a Pointer in C?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A pointer is indeed a derived data type that can store the memory address of other C variables or memory locations. Using pointers, you can access and manipulate the data stored in the memory locations they point to. This capability is essential for tasks such as dynamic memory allocation, data structure manipulation, and low-level memory access in the C programming language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The syntax of pointers will be similar to the variable declaration in C, however, we can use the&nbsp;( * ) dereferencing operator&nbsp;in the pointer declaration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>datatype * ptr;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>where<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>ptr&nbsp;<\/strong>&#8211; Name of the pointer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>datatype&nbsp;<\/strong>&#8211; The type of data it is pointing to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-use-pointers\">How to Use Pointers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of pointers can be classified into 3 :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pointer Declaration<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pointer Initialization<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dereferencing<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-pointer-declaration\">1. Pointer Declaration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In pointer declaration, we will declare the pointer won&#8217;t initialize it. To declare a pointer, we have to  use the&nbsp;<strong>( * ) dereference operator&nbsp;<\/strong>before its name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int *ptr;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The pointer which is declared will hence point to some random memory address as it is not initialized. Such pointers are called wild pointers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-pointer-initialization\">2. Pointer Initialization<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When initializing a pointer in C, you typically assign an initial value that is a memory address. The <code>&amp;<\/code> (ampersand) operator is used to obtain the memory address of a variable, and you can store that memory address in a pointer variable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int var = 10;\nint * ptr;\nptr = &amp;var;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, We can also declare and initialize the pointer in a single step. Therefore, This method is called<strong>&nbsp;pointer definition&nbsp;<\/strong>as the pointer is declared and initialized at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int *ptr = &amp;var;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-dereferencing\">3. Dereferencing <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dereferencing a pointer in C involves using the <code>*<\/code> (asterisk) operator to access the value stored in the memory address specified by the pointer. This allows you to work with the actual data pointed to by the pointer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pointer-in-c-example\">Pointer In C Example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\n\/\/ C program to illustrate Pointers\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n \nvoid geeks()\n{\n    int var = 10;\n \n    \/\/ declare pointer variable\n    int* ptr;\n \n    \/\/ note that data type of ptr and var must be same\n    ptr = &amp;var;\n \n    \/\/ assign the address of a variable to a pointer\n    printf(\"Value at ptr = %p \\n\", ptr);\n    printf(\"Value at var = %d \\n\", var);\n    printf(\"Value at *ptr = %d \\n\", *ptr);\n}\n \n\/\/ Driver program\nint main()\n{\n    geeks();\n    return 0;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Value at ptr = 0x7fff1038675c \nValue at var = 10 \nValue at *ptr = 10 <\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"type-of-pointers\">Type Of Pointers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pointers are classified into different types depending on the parameters.&nbsp;For instance,  we can take a look at the type of variable stored in the memory location pointed by the pointer. Thus,   the pointers can be classified into the following types:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-integer-pointers\">1. Integer Pointers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Integer pointers will point to the integer values<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int *ptr;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also referred as the <strong>Pointer to integer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed,  a pointer can point to any primitive data type. Moreover, It can also point to derived data types such as arrays and user-defined data types such as structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-array-pointer\">2. Array Pointer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pointers and arrays are closely related in C. An array name can be considered a pointer to its first element. This relationship is often referred to as &#8220;arrays and pointers&#8221; in C programming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>char *ptr = &amp;array_name;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-structure-pointer\">3. Structure Pointer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pointer pointing to Structure type is called Structure Pointer or Pointer to Structure<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>struct struct_name *ptr;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In C, structure pointers are mostly seen in data structures such as linked lists, trees, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-function-pointers\">4. Function Pointers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Function pointers will point to the functions. Although, they are different from the rest of the pointers in the sense that instead of pointing to the data, they will point to the code. For example,  a function prototype \u2013&nbsp;<strong>int func (int, char)<\/strong>,<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>the&nbsp;function pointer&nbsp;for this function will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int (*ptr)(int, char);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-double-pointers\">5. Double Pointers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In C, you can define pointers that store the memory address of other pointers. These are referred to as double-pointers or pointers-to-pointer. Instead of pointing directly to a data value, they point to another pointer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>datatype ** pointer_name;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dereferencing Double Pointer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>*pointer_name; \/\/ get the address stored in the inner level pointer\n**pointer_name; \/\/ get the value pointed by inner level pointer<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-null-pointer\"><br>6. Null Pointer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Null pointers are the pointers that won&#8217;t point to any memory location. Also, it can developed by providing a value to the null pointer. Hence, pointer of any type can be given values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>data_type *pointer_name = NULL;\n        or\npointer_name = NULL<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-void-pointer\">7. Void Pointer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Void pointers, also known as generic pointers, are pointers that don&#8217;t have an associated data type. They are used to create more flexible and versatile pointers because they can point to data of any data type, and they can be typecasted to any other data type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>void * pointer_name;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-wild-pointers\">8. Wild Pointers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild pointers in C are pointers that have not been initialized with a valid memory address or have been left pointing to a memory location that is no longer valid. They can cause serious issues in programs, such as crashes, memory corruption, and unexpected behavior, because they lack a well-defined target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>int *ptr;\nchar *str;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-constant-pointers\">9. Constant Pointers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A constant pointer is a pointer where the memory address is constant and cannot be modified once defined. It always points to the same memory address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Syntax<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>data_type * const pointer_name;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-pointer-to-constant\">10. Pointer to Constant <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A pointer to a constant is a pointer where the memory address is not constant, but the data it points to is constant and cannot be modified through the pointer. The pointer itself can be changed to point to different memory locations<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const data_type * pointer_name;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-type-of-pointers\">Other Type of Pointers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p> These are specialized types of pointers with specific purposes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Far Pointer<\/strong>: A far pointer is typically 32-bit and can access memory outside the current segment. They are often used in segmented memory models.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dangling Pointer<\/strong>: A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed). Using a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Huge Pointer<\/strong>: A huge pointer is a 32-bit pointer that contains both a segment address and an offset address. These were used in older memory models.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complex Pointer<\/strong>: Complex pointers are pointers with multiple levels of indirection, often used in more advanced data structures.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Near Pointer<\/strong>: A near pointer is used to store 16-bit addresses within the current segment, typically on a 16-bit machine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Normalized Pointer<\/strong>: A normalized pointer is a 32-bit pointer designed to have as much of its value in the segment register as possible. This was relevant in segmented memory models.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>File Pointer<\/strong>: A file pointer is a pointer to a <code>FILE<\/code> data type, often referred to as a stream pointer or a file pointer. It is used to interact with files and input\/output operations in C.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These various types of pointers serve specific purposes and are used in different contexts, depending on the memory model and requirements of the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"size-of-pointers-in-c\">Size Of Pointers In C<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your explanation of pointer sizes in C is mostly accurate. The size of pointers in C is indeed determined by the operating system and CPU architecture, not the type they point to. However, the sizes you provided are not universally true for all systems. The actual size of pointers can vary depending on the platform and the compiler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a more accurate description:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>On many 64-bit systems, pointers are typically 8 bytes in size, as they store 64-bit memory addresses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>On many 32-bit systems, pointers are usually 4 bytes in size, as they store 32-bit memory addresses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for the same size of pointers of a specific architecture is consistent with your explanation: Pointers store memory addresses, and the size of memory addresses is determined by the CPU architecture, not the data type they point to. However, it&#8217;s important to note that there can be exceptions and variations on different platforms, so it&#8217;s always a good practice to use the <code>sizeof<\/code> operator to determine the size of pointers on a specific system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-find-the-size-of-pointers-in-c\">How to find the size of pointers in C?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example: C Program to find the size of different pointer types.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\n\n\/\/ C Program to find the size of different pointers types\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n \n\/\/ dummy structure\nstruct str {\n};\n \n\/\/ dummy function\nvoid func(int a, int b){};\n \nint main()\n{\n    \/\/ dummy variables definitions\n    int a = 10;\n    char c = 'G';\n    struct str x;\n \n    \/\/ pointer definitions of different types\n    int* ptr_int = &amp;a;\n    char* ptr_char = &amp;c;\n    struct str* ptr_str = &amp;x;\n    void (*ptr_func)(int, int) = &amp;func;\n    void* ptr_vn = NULL;\n\n    \/\/ printing sizes\n    printf(\"Size of Integer Pointer  \\t:\\t%d bytes\\n\",\n           sizeof(ptr_int));\n    printf(\"Size of Character Pointer\\t:\\t%d bytes\\n\",\n           sizeof(ptr_char));\n    printf(\"Size of Structure Pointer\\t:\\t%d bytes\\n\",\n           sizeof(ptr_str));\n    printf(\"Size of Function Pointer\\t:\\t%d bytes\\n\",\n           sizeof(ptr_func));\n    printf(\"Size of NULL Void Pointer\\t:\\t%d bytes\",\n           sizeof(ptr_vn));\n \n    return 0;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Size of Integer Pointer      :    8 bytes\nSize of Character Pointer    :    8 bytes\nSize of Structure Pointer    :    8 bytes\nSize of Function Pointer    :    8 bytes\nSize of NULL Void Pointer    :    8 bytes<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what the type of pointer it is, the size of each and every pointer will be the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The type declaration is needed in the pointer for dereferencing and pointer arithmetic purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pointer-arithmetic\">Pointer Arithmetic<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pointer arithmetic refers to the set of valid arithmetic operations that can be performed on pointers.

What is C pointer in C?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable, which can be of various types. The size of a pointer is determined by the platform, typically 4 bytes in 32-bit architectures, but it can vary. Use <code>sizeof<\/code> to check the pointer size on your platform.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1697195916835\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2.

What is the syntax of pointer?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C, you declare a pointer by adding a <code>*<\/code> before the name and associate it with a specific data type (e.g., <code>int<\/code> or <code>double<\/code>). It&#8217;s a common convention to use &#8220;p&#8221; or &#8220;ptr&#8221; as a prefix or suffix in pointer variable names, like <code>iPtr<\/code>, <code>numberPtr<\/code>, <code>pNumber<\/code>, or <code>pStudent<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>C Pointers In C Pointers are indeed a fundamental concept in the C programming language.
