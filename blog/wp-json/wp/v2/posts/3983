It simplifies the process of managing and installing third-party libraries or packages in your PHP projects. Composer allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages them for you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Laravel uses Blade as its templating engine. Blade provides a simple yet powerful templating language for creating views in Laravel.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Laravel supports multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. You can configure the database connection settings in the <code>config\/database.php<\/code> file.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands for tasks such as migrating databases, seeding databases, generating boilerplate code, and more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.To define environment variables in Laravel, you can use the <code>.env<\/code> file in your project&#8217;s root directory. This file allows you to set configuration values, including database credentials, API keys, and other settings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Yes, Laravel can be used for Full Stack Development. While Laravel primarily focuses on the backend, you can integrate it with frontend technologies like Vue.js or React to create a full-stack application.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.To put a Laravel application into maintenance mode, you can use the <code>php artisan down<\/code> command. This will display a maintenance message to users accessing the application. After maintenance is complete, you can use <code>php artisan up<\/code> to bring the application back online.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.In Laravel, the default route files are <code>web.php<\/code> and <code>api.php<\/code>, located in the <code>routes<\/code> directory. These files define routes for web and API routes, respectively.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Migrations in Laravel are a way to version control your database schema. They allow you to modify database tables and structures in a structured and organized way using PHP code.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Seeders in Laravel are used to populate database tables with sample or default data. They are often used in conjunction with migrations to ensure that your application has initial data for testing or development.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Factories in Laravel are used to generate fake data for testing and database seeding. They work in conjunction with model factories and are particularly useful for creating large amounts of data for testing purposes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Soft delete in Laravel is a feature that allows you to &#8220;delete&#8221; a record from the database without actually removing it. Soft deleted records are marked as deleted but are not permanently removed, making it possible to recover them if needed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.In Laravel, models represent the underlying data structure of a database table. They are used to interact with the database, perform queries, and define relationships between tables.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ans.Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework designed for the development of web applications following the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides an elegant syntax and a variety of tools for tasks such as routing, authentication, caching, and more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> Ans.Laravel 8 introduced several new features, including Laravel Jetstream (a new application scaffolding), model factory classes, job batching, rate limiting improvements, dynamic Blade components, improvements to model factories, and more. For the latest changes, please refer to the official Laravel release notes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1. What is the latest Laravel version? 2. Define Composer 3.
