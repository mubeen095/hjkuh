Currently, web applications, mobile applications, and several other devices will require more data. Python&#8217;s data science libraries will allow the creation of buisness insights from this data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-python-for-embedded-systems-and-io-t\">4. Python For Embedded Systems and IoT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several automation products such as robotics, IoT, and kiosk applications are developed with Arduino and programmed with the help of Micropython.  Micropython is considered a lightweight version that is specially created for microcontrollers such as Arduino. Raspberry Pi is a well-known and affordable single-board computer for several web applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-python-for-computer-vision-and-image-processing\">5.  Python For Computer Vision and Image Processing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open CV is well-known for capturing and processing images.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/efficiency-empowered-data-structure\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"298\"> Image Processing algorithms<\/a> will take information from images, and reconstruct image and video data.  Computer vision will use image processing for face detection purposes and pattern recognition. Open CV is known as a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/python-vs-c\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6873\"> C++ <\/a>library. It&#8217;s Python Port functions for the development feature. Application areas include robotics, industrial surveillance, and automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-python-for-job-scheduling-and-automation\">6.  Python For Job Scheduling and  Automation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is considered the first application for automating CRO(Command Run On) Jobs. Several tasks include Periodic data backups will be written in Python scripts and planned automatically with the help of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/in-which-operating-system-we-can-use-azure-cli\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\"> operating system <\/a>automation scripts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-python-for-artificial-intelligence\">7. Python For Artificial Intelligence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Python consists of inbuilt libraries and a few tools that are used for the creation of AL Algorithms. Additionally, they will provide simple and readable code and can help the developers to write complex algorithms. Some of the tools that will improve the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"78\"> AI <\/a>Process are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a. Numpy for complex data analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b. Scipy for technical computing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c. Seaborn for data visualization<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-python-for-game-development\">8. Python For Game Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Python has an important role in the gaming industry and their development. Popular games such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Bridge Commander, and Battlefield 2 will take advantage of Python programming. Further, popular 2D and 3D gaming libraries such as pygame, panda3D, and Cocos2D will help in the game development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-python-for-audio-and-visual-applications\">9.
