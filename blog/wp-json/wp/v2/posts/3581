It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995. One of its key features is the &#8220;Write Once, Run Anywhere&#8221; (WORA) philosophy, which means that Java code can run on any device that supports Java without modification.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Java vs. Python:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Syntax:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Java has a statically-typed and verbose syntax, requiring explicit declaration of data types and more lines of code.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Python is dynamically typed and has a concise syntax, allowing for more expressiveness with fewer lines of code.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Performance:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Java tends to have better performance due to its static typing and compilation process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Python is generally slower as it is an interpreted language, but performance-critical modules can be implemented in compiled languages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platform Independence:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Java is platform-independent, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Python is also platform-independent, but it requires an interpreter on each platform.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community and Ecosystem:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Both languages have large and active communities with extensive libraries and frameworks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Python is known for its simplicity and readability, attracting a broad range of users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a. <strong>Object-oriented:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, emphasizing the creation and manipulation of objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b.<strong>Portable:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Java&#8217;s bytecode, generated by the compiler, is platform-independent, allowing Java programs to run on any device with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c.<strong>Platform-independent:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> The &#8220;write once, run anywhere&#8221; principle is a key feature of Java, enabling developers to create applications that can run on various platforms without modification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>d.<strong>Robust:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Java&#8217;s design includes features like strong type checking, automatic garbage collection, and exception handling, contributing to the language&#8217;s robustness and stability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.<strong>Interpreted:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>.While it&#8217;s true that Java code is initially compiled into bytecode, the bytecode is later interpreted by the JVM at runtime. However, Java also employs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which translates bytecode into native machine code for improved performance during execution. So, it combines elements of both interpretation and compilation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Object:<\/strong><br>An object is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates data and behavior. Objects are instances of classes, and they interact with each other through methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>StringBuffer vs. StringBuilder:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Both <code>StringBuffer<\/code> and <code>StringBuilder<\/code> are classes in Java used for manipulating strings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>StringBuffer:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Thread-safe (synchronized), making it safer for use in a multi-threaded environment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slower than <code>StringBuilder<\/code> due to synchronization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>StringBuilder:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Not thread-safe, making it more efficient in a single-threaded environment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Faster than <code>StringBuffer<\/code> because it is not synchronized.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>JDK, JRE, and JVM:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>JDK (Java Development Kit):<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It is a software development kit that includes tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It contains JRE, an interpreter\/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>JRE (Java Runtime Environment):<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It provides the runtime environment for Java applications to run.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components required for running Java applications but not for developing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>JVM is responsible for the execution of Java programs and translates Java bytecode into native machine code.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<strong>Inheritance:<\/strong><br>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (subclass\/derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (superclass\/base class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. <strong>Method Overloading:<\/strong><br>Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (either different types or a different number of parameters). The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments passed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.<strong>Overloading vs. Overriding:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Overloading:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Involves multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decided at compile time (compile-time polymorphism).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overriding:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Involves providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decided at runtime (runtime polymorphism).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>10. <strong>Thread-Safe Singleton with Double-Checked Locking:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>public class Singleton {\r\n    private static volatile Singleton instance;\r\n\r\n    private Singleton() {\r\n        \/\/ Private constructor to prevent instantiation.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static Singleton getInstance() {\r\n        if (instance == null) {\r\n            synchronized (Singleton.class) {\r\n                if (instance == null) {\r\n                    instance = new Singleton();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return instance;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <code>volatile<\/code> keyword ensures that the instance variable is not cached, helping to prevent multiple threads from creating separate instances.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The double-checked locking ensures that only one thread enters the synchronized block to create the instance, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary synchronization once the instance is created.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.What do you understand by Java? 2.
