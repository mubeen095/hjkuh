HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the basic code used to build web pages. In this guide for beginners, we&#8217;ll take you through the basics of HTML step by step, making it easy to understand and learn from scratch. By the end, you&#8217;ll have the foundation you need to create your own web projects and bring your ideas to life online. Let&#8217;s get started on your web development journey!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-html\">What is HTML<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML is the&nbsp;language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on&nbsp;teaching you how to build rather than design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"requirements-to-learn-html\">Requirements to Learn HTML <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning HTML doesn&#8217;t require any specific prerequisites. It&#8217;s a text-based computer code, and anyone can learn and use it, as long as they can understand letters and basic symbols. All you really need is some basic computer knowledge and the ability to work with files. So, it&#8217;s accessible and open to anyone who wants to give it a try!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benefits-of-learning-html\">Benefits Of Learning HTML <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.

You\u2019ll no longer have to wait for your IT team<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you tired of waiting for your IT team to fix typos on your company&#8217;s website or newsletter? HTML can change that. With HTML, you can make improvements and correct errors on your own, without needing to rely on busy IT teams. Plus, it&#8217;s an impressive skill that can earn you brownie points with your boss for taking initiative and helping the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. HTML helps you understand how to make things more accessible<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Semantic HTML tags are the building blocks for better accessibility.

It helps bridge the gap and ensures smoother communication with your technical team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being familiar with HTML means you&#8217;re on the same page as your tech colleagues. This saves time and streamlines discussions, making it easier to bring your ideas to life effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Your designs can shine with HTML<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re more inclined toward website design, a bit of HTML knowledge can be valuable. It allows you to showcase your graphic and layout concepts to clients effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be an expert; even basic HTML skills let you create mock-up designs for client presentations. This speeds up the feedback process and saves time on design edits, helping you work more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. &nbsp;HTML skills will open up more income-generating opportunities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML is a valuable skill \u2014 even for non-technical professionals. Still, it\u2019s also a great choice if you\u2019re looking to switch careers or venture into freelance development.&nbsp;Front-end engineers&nbsp;are highly in demand, and HTML is a core component of their skillset, so you\u2019ll want to learn it if you\u2019re considering entering the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> 7.
