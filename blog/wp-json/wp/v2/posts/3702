Global classes are used for exposing functionality to external applications or when building managed packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13.<strong>Getter Methods and Setter Methods:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.In Apex, getter methods (also called accessor methods) are used to retrieve the values of private variables, and setter methods (also called mutator methods) are used to set the values of private variables. They are essential for encapsulation and data integrity in object-oriented programming.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1. What is Salesforce? 2. Why is Salesforce important? 3.
