What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted declarations of char array in C?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C and C++, single quotes (<code>'<\/code>) represent single characters and double quotes (&#8220;) represent string literals. When you use a string literal &#8216;x&#8217;, it&#8217;s a two-character array containing the character <code>'x'<\/code> and a null terminator <code>'\\0'<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1697092727708\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2. What is the difference between single and double quotes in programming?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C and C++, you can include single quotes in double-quoted strings and double quotes in single-quoted strings without escaping them. If you want to include the same type of quotation marks within a string, you need to escape them with a backslash.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1697092736202\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3.
