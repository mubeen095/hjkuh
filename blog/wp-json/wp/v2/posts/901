They&#8217;re like puzzle pieces that help organize and connect information. Even though they both play a role in keeping things organized and accurate, they have different jobs. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what makes primary keys and foreign keys different and how they each contribute to making databases work well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-primary-key\">What Is Primary Key?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A primary key is a designated aspect within a database table that emphasizes individuality. It is embodied by a singular column or a combination of columns, serving to distinguish each row within the database distinctly. Essentially, it precludes the presence of identical values across different rows, while also mandating the absence of NULL values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-foreign-key\">What Is Foreign Key?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A foreign key is primarily utilized to create a connection between two tables. Its main role is to uphold the accuracy of data when dealing with two different sets of information that are related to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key\">Key Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Sl.

These two keys are important for the database . Hence, in short A primary key is used to assure the value in the particular column is unique. The foreign key provides the link between the two tables . <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faq-difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key\">FAQ &#8211; Difference Between Primary key And Foreign key<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1692188917011\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1.
