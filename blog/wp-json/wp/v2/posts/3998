Answers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Purpose of the Model in MVC:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Model in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern represents the application&#8217;s data and business logic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is responsible for managing data, processing business rules, and interacting with the database.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<strong>Role of the View in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The View is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interface interactions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It displays information from the Model and sends user input back to the Controller for processing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong>Role of the Controller in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Controller manages user input, processes it (along with data from the Model), and updates the View accordingly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user requests and updating the application state.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<strong>Advantages of Using the MVC Pattern:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Separation of Concerns:<\/strong> Clear separation of application logic, user interface, and data management.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Modularity:<\/strong> Components (Model, View, Controller) can be developed and tested independently.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reusability:<\/strong> Components can be reused in different parts of the application.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintainability:<\/strong> Easier maintenance and updates due to the modular and organized structure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<strong>Flow of Data in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>User interacts with the View.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>View sends user input to the Controller.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Controller processes input, interacts with the Model, and updates the View.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>View displays updated data to the user.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This cycle continues based on user interactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>6.<strong>Differences Between ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Web Forms:<\/strong> Event-driven, controls with server-side state, less control over HTML, follows a page-centric approach.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MVC:<\/strong> Separation of concerns, full control over HTML, supports test-driven development, follows an action-centric approach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<strong>Data Flow Between View and Controller in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>User interacts with the View (e.g., form submission).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>View sends data to the Controller.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Controller processes data, updates the Model if needed, and returns a response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>View displays the updated information to the user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<strong>Purpose of ViewBag in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>ViewBag<\/code> is a dynamic property that allows passing data from the Controller to the View.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is useful for sending small amounts of data between the Controller and the View without using strongly-typed models.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>9.<strong>Handling Form Submissions in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a form in the View with appropriate HTML helpers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit the form to an action method in the Controller.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Controller processes form data, performs necessary actions, and updates the Model or View.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use model binding to simplify handling form data in the Controller.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>10.<strong>Purpose of Routing in MVC:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Routing is the process of mapping URLs to Controller actions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It helps determine which Controller and action should handle a particular URL request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enables creating clean and user-friendly URLs for different parts of the application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1: What is the purpose of the Model in the MVC pattern? 2: What is the role of the View in MVC? 3: Explain the role of the
