Set of Virtual Machine Instances This refers to a group of virtual machines (VMs) that are created and managed together. Virtual machines are software-based instances that mimic physical computers. They can run different operating systems and applications on a single physical server, providing flexibility and scalability for computing tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set of Commodity Servers Commodity servers are basic, standardized servers that are not highly specialized. A &#8220;set of commodity servers&#8221; refers to multiple low-cost servers that are used collectively to handle computing workloads.
