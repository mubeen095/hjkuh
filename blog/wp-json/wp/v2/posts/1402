Option B) Like Operator is the Correct Answer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In SQL, the operator that performs pattern matching is the &#8220;LIKE&#8221; operator. The &#8220;LIKE&#8221; operator is used to match values in a column against a specific pattern, where the pattern can include wildcard characters to represent unknown or variable characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic syntax of the &#8220;LIKE&#8221; operator is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SELECT column_name(s)\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name LIKE pattern;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the &#8220;pattern,&#8221; you can use &#8220;%&#8221; to match any sequence of characters (including none), and &#8220;_&#8221; to match any single character. Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>LIKE 'a%'<\/code> matches any value that starts with &#8220;a&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>LIKE '%a'<\/code> matches any value that ends with &#8220;a&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>LIKE '%or%'<\/code> matches any value that contains &#8220;or&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>LIKE '_r%'<\/code> matches any value that has &#8220;r&#8221; as the second character.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SELECT * FROM customers\nWHERE customer_name LIKE 'J%';<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above query retrieves all rows from the &#8220;customers&#8221; table where the &#8220;customer_name&#8221; column starts with the letter &#8220;J&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the &#8220;LIKE&#8221; operator in SQL is specifically designed for pattern matching within the context of database queries and works with string data. If you&#8217;re dealing with pattern matching in a general-purpose programming language like Java, you would use regular expressions or other language-specific features for this purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A) BETWEEN operator B) LIKE operator C) EXISTS operator D) None of these Which Operator Performs Pattern Machining In SQL?
