When you drag a dimension field onto the view, it&#8217;s generally represented as blue in the Data pane, indicating that it&#8217;s discrete by default. You can also convert a dimension to continuous if needed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Measures<\/strong>: Measures in Tableau are typically numerical data that can be aggregated, such as sales figures, quantities, or any field with numeric values. When you drag a measure field onto the view, it&#8217;s generally represented as green in the Data pane, indicating that it&#8217;s continuous by default. You can also convert a measure to discrete if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The color distinction between blue (discrete) and green (continuous) fields in the Data pane is a useful visual cue for Tableau users to quickly identify the field type. However, it&#8217;s important to note that you can change the default aggregation method or field type for dimensions and measures to suit your specific data analysis needs.
