Both of the languages have Object Oriented Programming. Even though they have many differences. Check out this article to learn more about the Key differences between Python and C++.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>C ++ language is a middle-level, case-sensitive, and object-oriented programming language. The founder of C++ is Bjarne Stroustrup at the Bell Labs. It is also an independent programming language that will perform on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.  Whereas, python is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It is used in several fields such as Web development, Machine Learning, and other software development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-c\">What is C++<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/c-programming-language-tutorial\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1719\">C++ <\/a>is considered a high-level, general-purpose programming language and was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup. The language has rapidly changed over time. However, modern C ++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features. Several technologies that work in libraries in Python have C++ Code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c-example\">C++ Example<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can learn the syntax of C++ with the help of an example provided below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#include\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n   int a, b;\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"Enter The value for variable a \\n\";\n   cin &gt;&gt; a;\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"Enter The value for variable b\";\n   cin &gt;&gt; b;\n   cout &lt;&lt; \"The value of a is \"&lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; \"and\" &lt;&lt; b;\n   return 0;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we are providing input for 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/variable-length-arguments-for-macros\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3327\">variables <\/a>&#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; from the user with the help of the keyword and the data will be shown on the console.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Enter The value for variable a\n10\nEnter The value for variable b\n20\nThe value of a is 10 and 20<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-python\">What is Python?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/what-does-0-mean-in-this-python-string\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3237\">Python<\/a> is well known for its high-level, interpreted programming language. It was introduced by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. So, python is an object-oriented programming language and consists of a library that can allow the implementation of several programs and algorithms. The object-oriented approach and language constructs will help the programmers write, logical code for several projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-of-python\">Example Of Python<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>a = int(input(\"Enter value for a\"))\nb = int(input(\"Enter value for b\"))\n\nprint(\"The number you have entered for a is \", a)\nprint(\"The number you have entered for b is \", b)<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Enter value for a 10\nEnter value for b 20\n\nThe number you have entered for a is 10\nThe number you have entered for b is 20<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-difference-between-c-and-python\">Key Difference between C++ and Python<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Parameters<\/td><td>Python <\/td><td>C++<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Syntax<\/td><td>Python consists of short-hand syntax and several short-hand structural iterators.
