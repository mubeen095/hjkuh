It might sound a bit different, but it&#8217;s becoming a great option. In today&#8217;s tech-driven world, there&#8217;s a big demand for people who can use data to make smart decisions, and that&#8217;s where Data Science comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Even if you studied <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/can-commerce-student-do-data-analytics\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2786\">commerce<\/a>, you can bring a unique viewpoint to this field. Businesses everywhere are using data to make important choices, and your mix of commerce and data skills could be just what they&#8217;re looking for. In this article, we&#8217;ll look at the possibilities and things to think about if you&#8217;re considering jumping into Data Science after finishing your B.Com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-reasons-to-choose-data-science\">5 Reasons to Choose   Data Science <\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"7952\" height=\"5304\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-thisisengineering-3862374-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5843\" style=\"width:525px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-overlapping-topics\"><strong>1. Overlapping Topics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several topics are taught in both the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/digital-marketing-course-after-b-com\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1287\">B.Com<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/data-science-interview-basic-question\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5613\">data science<\/a>. One of the examples is Microsoft Excel. Anyone interested in pursuing B.Com or data science should focus on learning Excel as well. It will be a great advantage. One needs to look at data science as well as&nbsp;B.com course details&nbsp;for a better understanding of the curriculum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-data-analysation\">2. <strong>Data Analysation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both B.Com and Data Science involve working with data. This means gathering, storing, and analyzing information using different methods. Even if you don&#8217;t study both courses at the same time, there&#8217;s a good chance that your careers could connect because of the shared focus on dealing with data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-higher-employment-chances\">3. Higher Employment Chances<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student holds a&nbsp;B.Com&nbsp;degree, the opportunity for jobs might be low but if they have data science students, then the chances will be high. Therefore,&nbsp; choosing data analytics after a B.Com&nbsp;will boost your chance of securing a high-pay scale job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-improved-resume\">4. <strong>Improved Resume<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not planning to stick with Data Science for a long time, having some work experience in this field can make your resume much stronger. Corporate employers value work experience, so even a short time working in data science can make you more appealing in the job market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-more-income\">5. <strong>More Income<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Scientists will have high packages at the beginning of their careers. The stability and security of their job will be very high. This doesn&#8217;t happen in B.Com Jobs. Therefore, data science jobs would be more beneficial than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/data-science-vs-computer-science-salary\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4506\">computer science<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-become-a-data-scientist-after-b-com\">How to Become a Data Scientist After B.com?<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"5760\" height=\"3840\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3762800-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5846\" style=\"width:481px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"online-courses-and-bootcamp\"><strong>Online Courses and Bootcamp<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find lots of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/data-science-online-course\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5629\"> online courses<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/what-is-mern-stack-bootcamp\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4142\">boot camps<\/a>, some of which are free, and others you have to pay for. While the paid ones might seem a bit pricey, they are worth the investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"graduation\"><strong>Graduation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the value of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/data-science-government-colleges-in-india\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4546\">college<\/a> degree is crucial. While the idea of skipping college and jumping straight into a specific course might seem tempting, it&#8217;s not a wise choice. Besides the skills you gain, having a valid degree is vital for your corporate career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"learn-new-programs\"><strong>Learn New Programs<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The course you choose will teach you the basics of computer programs, but it&#8217;s recommended for all students to try learning additional programs on their own. You can find information about many programs on online platforms like YouTube.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"self-study\"><strong>Self-study<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to set aside enough time for self-study. Try gathering information from various platforms and, once you&#8217;ve learned, make your own data compilations. This hands-on approach boosts your practical knowledge, which can be beneficial for your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunt-job-opportunities\"><strong>Hunt Job Opportunities<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, having a strong resume increases your chances of landing a good job. However, it&#8217;s wise to keep your options open.
