What is Active Directory?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <strong>Active Directory (AD):<\/strong> Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft. It is used to manage and organize information about network resources (such as users, computers, and printers) in a distributed network environment. AD provides authentication and authorization services, allowing administrators to control access to resources and enforce security policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. What is DHCP and what is it used for?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):<\/strong> DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network. It eliminates the need for manual IP address configuration, making it easier to manage and scale large networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. What is the scope and super scope?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Scope:<\/strong> In DHCP, a scope is a range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign to devices on a subnet. It includes configuration settings such as the default gateway and DNS servers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Super Scope:<\/strong> A super scope is a collection of individual scopes that can be configured on a DHCP server. It allows a DHCP server to manage IP addresses from multiple non-contiguous scopes, providing more flexibility in addressing different subnets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. What is DNS?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <strong>DNS (Domain Name System):<\/strong> DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network. It serves as a distributed database that maintains a mapping between domain names and corresponding IP addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. What is forward and reverse lookup in DNS?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Forward Lookup:<\/strong> In a forward lookup, the DNS resolves a domain name to an IP address. For example, it translates &#8220;www.example.com&#8221; to its corresponding IP address.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reverse Lookup:<\/strong> In a reverse lookup, the DNS resolves an IP address to a domain name. For example, it translates an IP address like &#8220;192.168.1.1&#8221; to its associated domain name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. What is \u2018A\u2019 record and what is \u2018MX record\u2019?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Record:<\/strong> An &#8216;A&#8217; (Address) record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. It is used in forward lookups to associate a domain name with its corresponding IP address.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MX Record:<\/strong> An &#8216;MX&#8217; (Mail Exchange) record is a type of DNS record that specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email messages on behalf of a domain. It helps route emails to the correct mail servers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. What is the IPCONFIG command?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <strong>IPCONFIG Command:<\/strong> The <code>ipconfig<\/code> command is a Windows command-line utility that provides information about the IP configuration of a computer. It can display details such as the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers for all network interfaces on the system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. What would you use to connect two computers without using switches?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.To connect two computers directly without using switches, you can use a crossover Ethernet cable. This type of cable allows the two computers to communicate directly without the need for an intermediary network device. You would typically connect each computer&#8217;s network interface using the crossover cable, configure their IP addresses appropriately, and establish a direct network connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. What is domain?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. A domain is a group of computers recognized by a network, managed centrally using Active Directory. Active Directory, a service by Microsoft, provides centralized authentication and authorization. Installing Active Directory configures a server to act as a domain controller, creating and managing domains within a network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Tell me if your system is infected by a virus how you will recover the data?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Install a new hard disk.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install the latest anti-virus software on the new hard disk.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install an operating system on the new hard disk and ensure it has the latest patches.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Connect the infected hard disk as a secondary drive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run a thorough scan using the latest anti-virus software on the infected hard drive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean and remove any identified malware or threats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once the infected drive is clean, safely disconnect it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boot up the system using the new hard disk with the secure operating system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Copy necessary files from the now-clean infected hard drive to the new system.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1)&nbsp;What is active directory? 2)&nbsp;What is DHCP and what it is used for? 3)&nbsp;What is the scope and super scope? 4)&nbsp;What is DNS? 5)&nbsp;What is forward and reverse lookup in DNS? 6)&nbsp;What is \u2018A\u2019 record and what is \u2018MX record\u2019? 7)&nbsp;What is the IPCONFIG command? 8)&nbsp;What would you use to connect two computers without using &#8230; <a title=\"51 Desktop Support Engineer Interview Questions And Answers 2024\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/desktop-support-engineer-interview-questions-and-answers\/\" aria-label=\"More on 51 Desktop Support Engineer Interview Questions And Answers 2024\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":5487,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[42],"tags":[741],"class_list":["post-4063","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-interview-prep","tag-51-desktop-support-engineer-interview-questions-and-answers-2024","generate-columns","tablet-grid-50","mobile-grid-100","grid-parent","grid-33"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4063"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4063"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4063\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4068,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4063\/revisions\/4068"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5487"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4063"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4063"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4063"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
