Option D) All of the Mentioned is the Correct Answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) <strong>Views could be looked at as an additional layer on the table that<\/strong> enables us to protect intricate or sensitive data based on<strong> our needs<\/strong>: True. Views can act as an additional layer that allows you to control access to data in underlying tables, restricting or exposing only the necessary data as per your security and access requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) <strong>Views are virtual tables that are compiled at run time<\/strong>: True. Views are indeed virtual tables that represent the result of a SELECT query. They are not precompiled like stored procedures but rather generated at runtime based on the query definition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c) <strong>Creating views can improve query response time<\/strong>: True. In some cases, creating views can enhance query performance by simplifying complex queries, precomputing results, and reducing the need for complex joins. However, this may not always be the case and depends on the nature of the queries and the data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>d) All of the Mentioned<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>a) Views could be looked at as an additional layer on the table that enables us to protect intricate or sensitive data based on our needsb) Views are virtual tables that are compiled at run timec) Creating views can improve query response timed) All of the Mentioned Which Of The Following Statements About The Views &#8230; <a title=\"Which Of The Following Statements About The Views In SQL Server Is True?\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/which-of-the-following-statements-about-the-views-in-sql-server-is-true\/\" aria-label=\"More on Which Of The Following Statements About The Views In SQL Server Is True?\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":2731,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[224],"tags":[468],"class_list":["post-2728","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-question-answer","tag-which-of-the-following-statements-about-the-views-in-sql-server-is-true","generate-columns","tablet-grid-50","mobile-grid-100","grid-parent","grid-33"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2728"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2728"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2728\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2730,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2728\/revisions\/2730"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2731"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2728"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2728"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
